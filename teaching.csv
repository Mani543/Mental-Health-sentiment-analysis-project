teaching,wdead,2018/01/01,"Looking for BIG digital timers for my 7th grade team We want to have physical timers to start classes in all of our 7th grade classrooms. I've tried various options over the years and never really been satisfied.

If you use an online timer or whatever it's hidden every time you click something else on the screen. Does anyone know of a way to  use an app or program that will lock the timer in the forefront of a display?

or 

Does anyone know any cheapish digital timer with a large enough screen to be clear to all students in the classroom? I searched amazon but they are all 3"" x 3"" or so unless you spend $40+ dollars (on the KAGAN timers or whatever).

What do you use in your classroom? Any advice?",6.205652173913041,6.216433442028986,6.272282608695651,80.81755434782613,66.02898550724638,9.218840579710145,32.46739130434783,8.841846274778883,2.5692000000000004,557,21,107,8,8,177,92,138,0.013,0.947,0.04,0.3593,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,2,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,11,0,6,0,0,3,5,23,14,10,0,2,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,2,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,4,10,0,19,11,5,13,0,0,4,0,9,8,0,7,4,64,13,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20279806595478356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.282258027951456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2902226820733317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3632256570957226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17336652486136836,0.0,0.0,0.2144362415710436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17485483101671498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22810854162027155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17427478140041272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16006162817457606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1329504427982985,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.159768428243314,0.0,0.0,0.14689236077262466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12101369594449896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1409007424197103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5377235687632929,0.0,0.0,0.12240786974241412,0.16472940215758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13364393390900178

I'd like to be able to upload the word list and have the students practice their vocabulary words through the app (either through games or flashcards). Any good ones out there?

teaching,PixelsnInk,2018/01/03,"Hoping for some advice about a ""student"" Hey Reddit,

   I'm looking for a simple source of reading material I can use, to teach my Dad how to read. He never went beyond middle school, and was never a fantastic student prior. I've suggested taking classes at my Community College, however, he doesn't seem to want to spend the  money on classes that he feels he doesn't need. So, I decided that I'd try to teach him, but I have no clue how I would go about it without seeming condescending. Any advice or resources that you guys know of would be greatly appreciated.

What kinds of side jobs work well with teaching? I'm going into my student teaching this semester, and therefore having to leave my 9-5 job due to time conflict. However, still gotta make rent so it's time to job hunt. While I'm looking, I figured that I might as well get some related work experience in case I ever need a side job while teaching in the future.

I graduated from college with a degree in finance and minor in economics. I currently have a job in finance but have realized that I think I want to get into teaching. I would be open to teaching business but would also love to teach math if possible.

Obviously I don't have a degree in education so what should I do if I would like to become a teacher? I know there are alternative ways to get a teaching license without the degree and i was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience?

Like I said above, I am open to teaching business but would love to teach math, what would I have to do since I also do not have a degree in math?

I am going to do some more research but would appreciate any guidance or any experiences people have maybe had with this!",5.774716981132077,6.375487509433963,7.160685534591195,72.04366981132077,66.9874213836478,9.630440251572328,34.13899371069182,9.642632912329526,3.3660586163522,650,29,115,13,10,223,78,159,0.0,0.8340000000000001,0.166,0.9792,2,0,0,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,8,0,26,2,0,0,1,34,38,14,0,12,11,0,0,2,0,7,0,1,0,0,4,8,0,0,4,0,3,1,3,0,0,0,4,1,15,4,21,26,2,12,0,0,0,2,4,9,0,6,3,92,19,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2376927679357877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20212492941650725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10391420849016632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16413224097250267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2907455817818218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2329336944047579,0.0,0.08446063441257239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14747624243084967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08167424538626297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14521036957736966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2682594724606445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14930251428909025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10303008092008864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1675397042102087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1413657343698679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12293485226713198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09522570769547303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17531251253527252,0.1179626989729081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14325837796645502,0.16116530197984247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6334257804916288,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,studioline,2018/01/04,"MS Chemistry: Anyone have a good way to teach/test the periodic table? Right now I quiz my kids, 10 elements a week for 5 weeks to try and get them to memorize the most important elements. These are ones we will use in equations later in the unit. 
Right now my policy is to let them retest as many times as possible to get them correct in an effort to encourage mastery.  They need to know name, symbol, and atomic number. What is killing me is tracking what they got right/wrong. It is taking an way to much time on my end to prepare and individualize retakes.

So my question is how do you or your coworkers test the periodic table? Ask your coworkers, I would love some insight. 

Background: I am a second year teacher at a tiny Catholic middle school were all the grades are mixed together (don't ask, it's complicated). I am also the single science teacher. The last science teacher was a disaster and left me no old lesson plans, so no help there. I have completely rebuilt the curriculum but feel a little lost at sea here.

teaching,Halt_I_Am_Ragnar,2018/01/04,"Certificate or Masters Degree for non education bachelor's? I have a degree in International Relations with minors in French and Politics. I am trying to figure out whether I should go get my MAT in secondary education or if I should just try and get a certificate that leads to licensure?

From what I understand though, social sciences aren't exactly a burgeoning field in secondary education so I'm also considering taking courses in biology to teach that later on.

Any suggestion?

teaching,Anxious_fervor,2018/01/04,"Questions on curriculum/pacing guides? I am going to start looking for my first teaching job soon, but I have some questions as to what guidance I’d be given as a new teacher.

For example, how do you know what units you are supposed to teach? Or if you are required to teach a certain book? Is that all covered in curriculum guides?

I’ve also heard of schools that don’t give curriculum guides. What happens in that case? You just create units on your own, based off state standards?

teaching,jadeLO76,2018/01/06,"Please can I have some advice. Currently on a teaching degree and doubting it, any help? I am currently at university training for my QTS. I am mid way through second year, in a 3 year degree. I completed last year but found it very stressful. I am finding the year extremely tough with workload and placement pressure.

Whenever I google about 'the day in the life of a primary school teacher' nobody seems happy. It's just endless lists about workload and never having any free time. Its a life style, not a typical career.

This has really put me off of choosing this for my future. I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling under pressure like I do now experiencing high levels of anxiety which is forever getting worse because of the pressures.

As a result of this I do not think I will go into teaching, however I do not know what I want to do. I am trying to decide if I should finish my degree anyway, if it would be useful in other job sectors?

Thank you",4.516753246753247,6.038041427807485,5.773296409472881,77.46145721925134,70.55080213903744,8.123605805958746,30.4694423223835,8.634040054169528,2.579758135981665,765,32,134,13,14,256,120,187,0.152,0.743,0.104,-0.8155,4,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,1,0,0,5,10,0,5,11,0,18,3,0,2,1,30,29,7,0,6,8,0,1,1,0,3,3,0,0,0,11,5,0,0,8,0,2,2,5,6,0,1,1,2,20,5,24,24,2,27,0,0,0,0,2,11,0,5,14,101,31,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15932701501069318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2217542304685353,0.0,0.12473001837591785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09939154711949336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17095100534996233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10515141308179687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08244113811751955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1490214183141699,0.0,0.0,0.17877191698427958,0.0,0.0,0.0851849930997866,0.0,0.09266300323820753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17356588101586853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10928653758410294,0.17226743017523866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16179835286548966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08960601488897746,0.13290454411228406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3454933956972093,0.0796562152294595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12575140356857595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17897594030575872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16390662452574958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10445167263146264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16501161996204675,0.0,0.14843128166254366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18676905338594896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15011118142019236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10447352333920834,0.0,0.0,0.09507364313103234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11069777513326164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1408197044164691,0.0,0.13453032179095156,0.19233793387580936,0.12941861061000018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.166158169285692,0.11582345542213705,0.0,0.0,0.4199860381065999

teaching,SerSunnybutt,2018/01/08,"Teaching GitHub Hi r/teaching. I'm a raider from the galactic accounting department. I know nothing about the teaching profession, except for having been on the receiving end, as it were. I do know a little bit about business process improvement,* and I'm wondering if what the accounting world knows could make your lives a bit easier. 

I was talking with an elementary school teacher the other day. She was frustrated with her curriculum and started asking her students meta-questions to gauge how well she was doing. The answer: terrible. This is a good thing, because now she knows there's a problem and can correct it. She did this before a graded assignment, and got a lot more information from it. 

This leads me to two questions: 

1. From the outside (having recently escaped college), the industry looks bloated, tired, running on an ineffective treadmill making the same mistakes over and over again. This may or may not be justified, so I'd like to hear from anyone closer to the action. Has anyone ever tried applying lean manufacturing techniques* to education?

2. Teachers have a better grasp of what their classroom needs than distant textbook authors, granted. I did some cursory googling and found resources for elementary teachers that look like they were designed for elementary students. Is there a resource more like a GitHub for education: where teachers can share insights, techniques, and anecdotes freely?

I have been looking into the Teaching Fellowship with Penns Graduate School of Education, wondering if anyone here has done it and what do you think? It's apparently a two year program when you work at a school and do online coursework, and go to UPenn in Philly a few times a year. 
Would love to hear some thoughts and experiences.

teaching,nattilyfizzle,2018/01/08,"I absolutely love gaming, but find no time for it as a teacher. I am a fourth year teacher. I am about to start at my third school (my last two were in the country) and was looking for advice from teachers who are also gaming nerds.

I am a big simulation (sims4 mainly), Nintendo, and puzzle game fan. The past 3 years I have barely played games due to being new to teaching, finding my feet, and living 9 hours away from home by myself for the first time. I was only able to play when I was relief teaching and didn’t have as much pressure.

My question: how do you find time to play games and unwind as well as prep, mark and plan? I feel like all my time is put to my work and then I go home, eat and sleep. I sometimes stay at school until odd hours as well.

teaching,Mooglenator,2018/01/09,"How do I become a substitute in California? For some context I recently graduated this past December with a Bachelors in History (Teaching Track), I passed the CBEST and the whole CSET for my single subject focus (social studies). I still have to enroll in a teaching credential program in the fall since I missed out on the deadline for the spring program. I am unemployed right now and the credential program is going to cost a pretty penny so I would like to start subbing ASAP. I live in So Cal specifically the high desert region (Victorville, Adelanto, Apple Valley, Hesperia, Phelan, etc.)My questions are:

*What do I have to do to become a sub that I haven't already done.

*Where do I go exactly? Does each city have its own department I need to register with or is it done by county?

*Would I be able to sub any grade? I would prefer high school but am open to subbing any grade.

*What about private schools? Is there some 3rd party I have to contact to become available for that?

teaching,Motorvision,2018/01/09,"Five ways I think we can improve education Views from an elementary school teacher living in the Midwest. This is my second year full time, on top of three previous years of subbing full time and one year of overseas teaching

Obviously the biggest one would be ""Pay them more"", but these are other things that I think would help

1. Stop guilting teachers
I've seen admin, teachers, parents, random people all do this: a teacher might contemplate quitting on social media, or complain about work conditions, stress, whatever. And they're usually met with ""But think of the kids!!!"" or ""Lol but you guys have three months off!"". Yes, the students are important, and yes, teachers get a decent amount of vacation time, but those shouldn't be reasons for ignoring the issues going in our schools. The biggest example I can think of is from a couple of weeks ago, last year's Oklahoma teacher of the year moved to Texas for better pay and work conditions, and this year's Oklahoma teacher of the year basically said ""He obviously doesn't care about the kids!!!"". We need to stop shaming teachers for wanting better than what they have

2. Don't glorify the stress they go through
Teaching is the epitome of America's toxic obsession with work, as in, the idea that the more hours you work, the better a worker you must be. I see teachers basically bragging about the amount of time they work now, one person might say they work 65 hours a week and another might say they're working 75. The martyring of teachers is something that absolutely needs to end. We need to stop saying ""Wow, you work so hard and so long for those kids, you're a hero!"". Yes, God bless teachers who are going above and beyond despite the garbage pay and unrealistic expectations, but I'm sure most of those teachers would trade being a ""hero"" for better pay and a better work environment. Not to mention that, unless a teacher somehow got hired at gunpoint, they generally know what they're getting into nowadays if they're younger/newer. That doesn't justify how stressful a lot of schools are, but it's not like these people were signed up blindly either. Related to this, teachers themselves need to stop being self-congratulatory. Hell, wearing a shirt that says ""I teach, what's your superpower?"" is just cringey. There is nothing particularly unique about being a teacher, unless you count ""getting shit on a lot"" as being a unique part of the job. They might as well wear something that says ""I work long hours for terrible money but refuse to do much about it, what's your superpower?"". I've met a lot of good teachers, but I've never seen such a job with so many people patting themselves on the back as often (maybe programmers and nurses too?)

3. Make education degrees tougher to get
Again, I've met a lot of good people who are teachers, and I respect a lot of what they do, especially given the conditions. But let's not fool ourselves, teachers are dime a dozen, and most teachers aren't particularly intelligent, creative, etc. Nice people, yes, but nothing special. Think of it this way: if we required teachers to get degrees in whatever subject they wanted to teach, we'd lose most of our teachers. I think it's telling that a lot of teachers I've met give the impression that if they didn't teach, they'd probably just be a stay at home moms, or work retail somewhere. I've never met a teacher and thought, ""Damn, that person would make a great engineer"". Which leads me to my next point

4. We need diversity
When I was going through college the education department was basic white girl headquarters, with a chunk of those being girls who a) thought nursing was too hard, or b) couldn't figure out anything else to do with their lives. This didn't change when I was subbing, as again, at least 95% of the teachers I met were white. We need more women of color, and we need more men (of any kind) in our schools, especially elementary school. The abundance of average white women in our schools might actually be hurting us as we enter 2018 and have more diverse students than ever. Though maybe if we paid better we'd get more kinds of people applying... (Related: the whole ""white woman savior"" complex really needs to end. Nothing makes me cringe more than the white girl who decides to try and teach in the ghetto because she wants to ""rescue"" the kids)

5. Feminism
Before people start get up in arms about this, hear me out. For a field that's so heavily dominated by women, a lot of the teachers I've met either vote Republican or are strangely apathetic to social/political issues as a whole (unless, of course, it concerns their job/pay directly). One thing we could be doing is hiring more socially aware teachers (NOT social justice warriors/Tumblr feminists). After all, for a lot of kids, who better to empower them than their teachers, since they're not getting it at home? But that doesn't happen, because oftentimes the teachers themselves don't seem to care/know anything 

I look forward to hearing (constructive) responses from you all",8.415377097751346,8.12906255796317,7.903022088575412,71.95211731930044,61.55687973997834,10.524943064983308,37.90499038185155,9.908190646982085,3.767373113405709,4003,176,685,69,49,1263,376,923,0.092,0.8009999999999999,0.107,0.9632,7,0,2,1,0,0,157.0,17,8,15,26,29,39,3,6,60,5,66,6,5,6,10,144,124,55,0,24,32,2,2,1,0,11,1,8,2,16,45,35,0,7,15,0,9,9,17,15,1,9,23,22,58,24,113,73,34,81,2,2,12,0,89,30,3,29,42,446,103,38,0.0,0.0,0.04133474141481605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03754730587360452,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02880450480586708,0.044415458425036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06971311138274873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032570248997516635,0.0,0.051641392195622284,0.0,0.036043053042374,0.0,0.0,0.2622319320244609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08637244544268967,0.0,0.04480854440163195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033818961091185415,0.0468676904936268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03538419746491394,0.0,0.07503222101696827,0.0,0.04723973097958612,0.0,0.03831472032086036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17704007092509302,0.04063310637664105,0.09629081407688396,0.07105480507100909,0.033877106087317026,0.046699215960225186,0.0,0.041940514991267636,0.03745653534141686,0.0,0.0758878746225502,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09547980380254076,0.0,0.02839129238172101,0.0,0.08497591153519593,0.0,0.12514060848543768,0.0,0.04534450472690677,0.047816382552681835,0.0,0.08842030394507035,0.12609963984493153,0.0,0.0,0.08821749013344052,0.0465570714218302,0.03452695871023798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04331334183989447,0.0,0.020693700675259125,0.0,0.07480477318848555,0.0749699850385943,0.03556957309467894,0.04738712940717092,0.0,0.2880861772366351,0.0,0.0,0.0848217400357078,0.04294378562087107,0.0851074630483837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22467269698428724,0.0,0.049608509923447286,0.03380929640421035,0.04501924456925467,0.03113758465858595,0.2512599802825114,0.06533732232809927,0.040909069708767454,0.045047607195219865,0.0,0.0,0.121929289022914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11480996277973148,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047032913200408526,0.04586896884160078,0.0,0.20555715999062096,0.07396974791050187,0.0,0.0,0.040041462353002405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04566847349117068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04505234053975512,0.0,0.0,0.027135254195033008,0.04355049252045521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040291615554763315,0.1684216416540917,0.0,0.257207882267397,0.033753387566894506,0.03856061331462533,0.044188037160635935,0.0,0.04347929306305396,0.035038503693329864,0.0,0.0,0.17271226219881533,0.0,0.0652176378126166,0.0,0.0,0.029980806870427944,0.04514738439994116,0.0,0.14165083202676346,0.14556087839612558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.039921376367486036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03702226068066975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05628078853923005,0.16284558443382213,0.04161595978123083,0.06725413588280914,0.09879583193314312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028757914463122345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050950772793939315,0.0,0.04665072478288081,0.0,0.07495052873134334,0.06724271250037474,0.06795315055267423,0.0,0.0380844163708088,0.0,0.0,0.09458111554487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3392038475732073,0.0,0.0,0.12035801152618665,0.0,0.0,0.1909375726279233

I was lucky when a friend referred me to VIPKID. I can make my own hours and the kids are absolutely adorable and actually want to learn. If you haven't heard of it, check out some of the YouTube videos to see fun videos other teachers made (that's what sold me).

teaching,DoTheThingRightNow5,2018/01/09,"Comprehension problem with teaching adults? (18-30) I'm an engineer. My boss wanted me to explain how I talk to customers on the phone because people seem to love me and we needed more technical people to talk to clients.

I spent maybe 30min prep and then explained how to talk to customers to a group of 5. I told them some helpful phrases to get customers to explain what they want or for clarification, how to interrupt them politely when they go off topic, how to ask questions and give a recommendation which i spent 20+min on because it was important.

At the end after questions this one guy went up to me and said that was basic. Just be polite and use (2 phrases I gave them), that's not hard. **That pissed me the fuck off**. I spent twenty minutes on how to get information with open ended questions and this guy thinks all you have to do is ask what they want and be polite. What the fuck. I understood these people have no social skills but that was ridiculous. I'm not sure what everyone else got out of it.

Anyways if I have to teach this again to people with zero social skills how do I know people will comprehend what I am saying? Because I don't now if he was an idiot or if I did a shitty job. I'm learning on the former since a few people asked questions and obviously understood what I was getting at",3.237765419615773,5.3544557054263615,4.243697337377824,84.6167896865521,75.27906976744184,6.657499157398046,25.94607347489046,7.586124646067393,1.4386486012807551,1044,38,199,14,23,338,139,258,0.098,0.857,0.045,-0.9479,1,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,1,1,6,2,11,8,5,0,11,0,17,4,1,8,3,55,52,22,0,8,9,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,17,14,0,0,15,0,3,2,4,6,0,2,16,3,26,2,34,33,4,21,0,0,0,3,37,11,3,11,8,140,43,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2935559971276737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1914169524598618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08743806671354565,0.0,0.1854124953223135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001634187612186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1935308207892235,0.16405672561743925,0.10040867168634476,0.05948617764684886,0.0,0.08371388569888802,0.0,0.0,0.20727883126037944,0.0,0.0,0.09376345260586044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07015786410920483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1038684828375549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05752370561754098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09446845116207457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10515473806102464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07761122369728382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0709268678120228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4353885622011829,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10015472489481073,0.0,0.0,0.4690158782121249,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09956481201438196,0.0832375116239826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09528732375130744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08658382111161561,0.0,0.0,0.21339506596640756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09864991211339598,0.0,0.0,0.2523885141526268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0670680892218897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10001634187612186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09040097622953826,0.0,0.0,0.1852106251081441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09702981979951712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,CorvusRiddle,2018/01/10,"Teaching students in various languages Hello reddit,

I'm a first-year English teacher at a high school that caters primarily to Spanish-speaking students, but also to a significant immigrant population (French, Arabic, etc.). I'm trying to put together a list of ""stock"" teacher phrases or sentences which I can translate into Spanish, French, and other languages as part of a reference document, and I wanted to know if any of you could help contribute to my list! The idea is to create a document for any given language that I can resort to to get across basic information to students who do not speak English, not as a replacement to but in addition to actually learning the languages myself. The types of phrases I'm thinking of are...

""How are you today?""
""We are studying...""
""The word for ___ is ____""
""Please work by yourself/with a partner.""
""You're doing very well!""
""You should work on...""
etc.

I don't need help with the languages so much as the phrases I should include in these documents. Ideally, I'd like to distribute these documents to some of the other new teachers in my school. What other basic phrases do y'all think could be included?

Thanks! Any and all help is much appreciated.",4.82045287637699,7.2917616744186065,5.782227662178703,73.76156670746634,71.79069767441861,8.247246022031824,34.10648714810281,8.99025400887824,3.5219767441860483,940,49,148,20,19,309,122,215,0.0,0.835,0.165,0.9884,0,0,0,0,0,0,50.0,1,4,0,3,4,4,0,0,15,0,17,0,0,1,1,31,28,13,0,8,6,0,0,1,1,2,0,1,0,1,10,7,0,0,7,0,0,1,3,0,1,0,1,1,13,4,34,22,8,12,0,0,0,0,13,9,0,3,3,110,23,11,0.0,0.0,0.1531503797901411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12550451601491314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3201728642558476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2506069498896901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.350058207361349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13349271656604167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08199444695973361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155798533265988,0.16581527041796054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1771656697847154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08624988237635682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07667274571466043,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2307372806982555,0.11636870127043115,0.0,0.15157321295140305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1699502587466367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17227251785157152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15776761307337847,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3176624433101388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1444888689326166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2011210767628664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1487603602224595,0.0,0.0,0.10655166504612278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12949157983311155,0.09256702350759663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14110751952556252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285077496291517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10106393647593817
teaching,RussellWD,2018/01/10,"Help in possible pathways to teaching - Not thinking it will be easy Ok, so I really wish it were simple figuring out how to become a teacher post undergrad.  I will give some background and see if anyone has any suggestions or advice.

I am 29 years old, I have an undergrad degree in Communications, a Master's degree in Finance, and I have been working in the finance field for 7 years.  I have been coaching High school soccer for 5 years and would love to be able to switch careers to teach and coach full time.  

To me it seems almost impossible to become a teacher without going back to school full time for 2 years.  This isn't really an option right now as I wouldn't be able to do it with my full time job in finance.  I am wondering if there are other options that could use the schooling I already have to help get me into teaching.

For background I live in Colorado.  At one point I was working at a private inner city school desperate for teachers.  I said I would love to do it and they came back with they wanted a Master's in teaching before they would have considered me.  Currently I am an assistant coach at a normal public school in the area.

I am just really lost, and I have a great passion for the kids and love the teaching aspects of it, and figure I would absolutely love to be able to do all of it full time.  None of the schools I have been at for coaching have been helpful in wanting to help or sponsor, because I guess that might be a thing for an alternative license.  Any suggestions?",5.812003766478341,6.172386518644067,6.361666666666667,78.64298964218459,66.86440677966101,8.996233521657247,32.66007532956685,8.841846274778883,2.6732900188323923,1193,48,224,18,18,389,144,295,0.017,0.8370000000000001,0.147,0.9901,2,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,3,5,7,8,0,0,18,1,38,5,0,2,1,44,57,15,0,12,7,0,0,0,0,8,0,1,0,1,12,13,0,0,5,5,3,2,5,1,0,1,9,2,26,7,44,34,7,40,0,1,1,5,17,24,0,12,13,166,38,20,0.2610006328572462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08501559924009762,0.0,0.0,0.08711814411440925,0.0,0.0960068961832834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11832625362399438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06083257035358981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13379558403975106,0.0,0.0530345210898291,0.19216979547502386,0.07403077165218858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09950506420891136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06946258917390792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454019421351036,0.08345852989067626,0.04944422480490584,0.0,0.0,0.09591803971276353,0.09584054085459642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2332576300626581,0.0919204995142642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.086334285017498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07682278018873645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09497100745886096,0.0,0.3140843483982915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09229347529117972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08524173483954718,0.0,0.0,0.0912920863838325,0.0,0.05895359452451331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08224332030335632,0.09807966582694637,0.08332215301285567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16720368871151547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07429770479228621,0.08275712346358954,0.0,0.0,0.5282931492205939,0.06932790417379148,0.07920172455167092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05779907434387557,0.05574622226375744,0.0,0.0,0.20292209057406704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0751402488459101,0.0,0.0,0.10262995703494956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000459490039426,0.08386509874836065,0.09434801759736353,0.12667437948173985,0.0,0.0,0.2472098148103973,0.0,0.0,0.2241011337575784

teaching,roryana,2018/01/11,"How do you manage a rotating classroom allocation? Student teacher here - I haven't yet started, but the school I'll be teaching at has a rotating classroom system where you aren't in the same physical room for the year (or even the week). Students check a noticeboard in the hall at the beginning of the period to find the room that they'll be in for that day. On top of this, not every room has the same equipment - some have desks, some don't, some are bright with lots of windows, others are basically a bunker. 

I'm really concerned, particularly as a new teacher, about how to get students to be fairly calm and focused. Battling your way through a hundred other students to check your classroom, then yelling it down the hall to your friends, is not a great start to the period.

teaching,HondaAnnaconda,2018/01/11,"Some college or high school teacher ought to do an experiment convincing their students that the earth is flat. With the recent revelations that most people are idiots and only need a few facebook posts to convince them to grab their assault rifle and attack a pizza shop and that a renowned hoodlum real estate scoundrel can *make America great again*, a teacher of voting age students should present a *convincing* presentation, with video (I'm sure there's plenty available) that poses the proposition that the earth is flat. The presentation should be preceded by asking the students whether the earth is global or flat. Those who already believe the earth is flat should be given praise for their innovative and original thinking. 

The presentation should be completed in one class session as if the administration is right-leaning, they may try and stop it for fear it will expose the gaping maw of gullability in today's world, thus setting off a cascade of forbidden concepts such as *the climate is changing from man's activities, war isn't inevitable etc..*",10.111803278688527,10.535794743169395,8.82787431693989,64.36541803278689,57.85245901639344,11.03584699453552,41.79726775956284,10.577609850970193,4.778421202185792,870,43,126,17,10,268,122,183,0.104,0.795,0.101,-0.1779,0,0,0,1,0,0,20.0,0,0,5,1,3,11,4,1,19,0,20,1,0,3,1,27,26,11,1,7,4,0,1,0,0,7,0,0,0,1,9,7,1,1,1,2,1,0,1,5,0,1,1,1,5,6,17,15,4,19,1,0,0,0,9,6,0,6,11,87,14,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2277144511059672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1929111695084927,0.2347550743124972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23248792609683103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21829294718025904,0.0,0.2163560394219635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2301369133330041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20185175242156603,0.0,0.2322032548983637,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2275036964287925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2180221101233932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1377414945044727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15300731795899838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13982938675826884,0.1569399172759254,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14305842419618786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1976280776962928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23487363651421425,0.0,0.0,0.20374760515261567,0.0,0.0,0.1762233937123623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2088391377430324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17251942685585125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19448422213048908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13222196434502667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19559747155171348,0.0,0.0,0.14009939369251498,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Password_isnt_123,2018/01/11,"I need to learn to go by Mr. Password_Isnt_123... This is a silly little problem that I know isn't all that important but...

I just started my first teaching gig at a high school (Im fresh out of college) and if I had a penny for every time I've introduced myself to kids instinctively by my first name or signed an email to a student with my first name, well I'd probably have more money than my salary provides. 

I just can't seem to break the habit. Being fresh out of college and relatively young, I've just never gone by Mr. Password_Isnt_123 before. Any tips for breaking this habit or is it just a matter of getting used to it and breaking the habit naturally?

Luckily I do catch myself and correct quickly, and the kids I teach are super respectful and call me Mr. Password_Isnt_123 anyway. But still, Im finding it to be a minor frustration.

teaching,teachreddit,2018/01/12,"Vocal strain. Ideas? My wife is a teacher in a difficult urban high school where the student culture is largely to talk over her, laugh and joke loudly, play music on cell phones, etc. In order to have even a chance to be heard, she must speak very loudly all day. (She's also very stressed)

I've noticed lately she is having problems with her voice. She clears her throat now every 30 seconds (*never* did this before this job this year), and today she barely can talk and is just taking the evening off from talking to me for that.

Any experience with this? Options? I was thinking about using a mic and speaker system, though I'm not sure how that will work since these students tend to destroy equipment left there and there is no good place to lock it up and I wouldn't want her carrying anything further. Maybe we can work out something.

We have taught before at the college level and although I myself noticed some very minor soreness (not as bad as she has) for about the first week of lecturing, it always would go away as my voice got ""into shape"". So *some* of this may be due to her having almost two weeks off for the holiday break and she's gotten a bit vocally out of shape, but I'm looking for ways where she can cut down on all the shouting. It can't be good for her voice in the long term, and it's no fun even if it is ""only"" 2-3 times a year that she goes through this.

Thanks.

teaching,ToadvineChigurh,2018/01/12,"I'm done. Howdy folks. I'm a first year teacher, and I've had it. I work at an alternative school in Oklahoma that houses students for a set number of days who would otherwise be on long-term suspension. 

This place is a tough environment. I know that, and I expect that. I've been cussed at and threatened more times than I can count.  Honestly though, the kids are, by and large, great. I just can't deal with an administration that won't support me when I specifically ask for it. 

In the past few days, I've written up two students that i feel don't need to be in my class for a couple of days. The first one cussed me out in front of other students, and this isn't the first time I've had to send him out of class. I'm not real thrilled that he's back rather than being in ISD, but I wasn't going to throw a fit about it either. 

The second student, however, is a different story. Today at lunch, the conversation my students were having steered in the direction of one of them being called gay as an insult. Now, that particular student is straight and isn't thin-skinned, but I sternly told my students to change the subject. Instead, another student chose to call that student a fag. I absolutely do not tolerate hate speech in my class. I sent the offending student straight to the office, and the rest of us returned to class. That student was back in my class in five minutes. I went down to the office and respectfully disagreed with the decision to not send her to ISD, and I pointed out that the word she used was no different than calling somebody a racial slur. The teacher in charge of discipline argued that it wasn't, and the principal agreed that nothing else should be done other than the student's parents be called. He gave the old, ""we'll hammer down next time"" speech and called it a day. 

Now, I understand that kids will be kids, and I've said as many off-color things as the next guy, but as a teacher, I can't sit by and say that it's not a big deal to use homophobic slurs. Especially not in school. I'm going to stick it out for the rest of the semester, but I don't get paid enough to start fudging my principles. Not for 33k a year for damn sure.

teaching,therealdonniej,2018/01/12,"I could use some advice as a new teacher and high school coach... Background: I am a first year teacher in an extremely diverse high school in New York State. I am teaching a full load of courses, but I am technically a “long-term substitute” with a job guaranteed for just this single school year. But rumor has it the person I am filling in for is not coming back, and I may be asked continue on as a probationary teacher. 

While I love what do, the environment I am in is not my ideal situation, but a job is a job, and I would be happy to stay if they asked me. 

The problem/question: I was recently offered a head coaching position for a spring sport at a well-regarded public school out in the suburbs (about 20 minutes commute from my school). It is my dream coaching position and the added cash could help me pay for my continued education. 

I want to know if it is a bad look for me at my current job if I take a coaching position at the other district and cut my after school availability with students from 1 hour to 30 minutes? 

Added catch: the school I will be coaching for will have an open job next school year that I could have a chance at interview for.

teaching,MuddlingZombies,2018/01/12,"Need some help from folks who are heavily involved in unions and teacher’s rights... Last year I was placed on leave from my building. My story can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/u/StrugglingEducator/?st=JCBEIY2T&amp;sh=1aac0c53

I initially published my story anonymously on Reddit because I was scared to come forward about what had happened even somewhat publicly last year if there was any chance of it being traced back to me. I didn’t do anything wrong outside of being sad, but HR deemed me to be a danger to myself and placed me on leave. 

But anyway, to make a long story short, I’m looking to get back in the classroom next year. I hate not being a teacher. One of the union reps from my former district came in to the bar I work at tonight, and told me that he remembered my case, but told me that I might not be able to find another job in the classroom. 

I’m only accepting constructive advice from folks who are deeply involved in their unions and might be able to read my story and tell me straight up whether it is a dealbreaker or not. I’m also not accepting critiques from folks who want to pick on me for crying at school in the first place, either. I’m frustrated because I haven’t been able to get a straight answer from anyone about my situation—not even from reps form my former union. 

I have a great opportunity to network right now. I’m subbing in an amazing district, and I even have a primary building that I get to work in. I just don’t want to get all excited when jobs post in the spring and have it all be over.",9.682187744458927,7.570792264406783,8.419999999999998,75.11281616688396,60.254237288135606,11.110821382007826,37.26857887874837,9.265573868473778,3.1775945241199484,1238,43,236,15,13,379,149,295,0.087,0.797,0.115,0.8201,2,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,0,0,1,4,14,12,3,1,14,0,26,1,0,2,2,38,47,15,0,4,12,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,10,9,1,0,6,2,0,3,7,6,0,2,10,1,29,6,44,27,6,45,0,1,1,0,12,26,0,6,17,160,39,9,0.3213737624734679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10468090708297348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566749391362996,0.0,0.11606944579048754,0.0,0.0728483929526172,0.11232947034932568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07490400234453809,0.0,0.08815440789882341,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16474439074907438,0.0,0.13060430848027094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12252198977414865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09227834666441127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11767132917593033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21226433916558554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0979099322413815,0.09112011939535636,0.0,0.11745658091705564,0.0,0.0,0.22387270223932887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11810523589201526,0.0,0.0,0.09472991893404607,0.0,0.0,0.10576335207566648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.071803352905931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21260924697991415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17464167306704664,0.0,0.2268589411675373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09480188891549578,0.0899576734757899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07150649398640106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2272845171398595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07943152425397274,0.0,0.0,0.11392821409879253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07259039289012235,0.08147307600581345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3357671808661889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10259574284548714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071535769259062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12135127493718645,0.18296762479729076,0.0,0.0,0.10725040011403217,0.10841580164982467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936316111745936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047242681422851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1263697144092821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1559759510824817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11712391972210312,0.0,0.20695416638022346

Any other things I should know before going to a recruiter?",2.6200252525252523,5.093527113636366,3.777878787878791,85.39237373737376,79.0,6.183838383838387,24.550505050505052,7.3871296695380915,1.3599580808080811,358,13,65,5,9,116,66,88,0.026,0.903,0.07,0.594,1,0,0,0,0,0,11.0,0,2,0,1,7,1,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,3,0,15,14,6,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,9,3,0,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,13,10,2,9,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,3,2,50,13,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19139660704658512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4882692817179142,0.2509642632697615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22486369132463574,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20365698280564346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2094442119489189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1580789182971334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12504298206201134,0.0,0.13601994705985734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2400731388385933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1315325963492835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2538972685406717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17593921735674434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26981494817785223,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2422204226836914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15900394967022854,0.15335659990670913,0.0,0.0,0.1395585233971631,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20670912953763446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17423918019680384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15412429090573682
teaching,InfiNorth,2018/01/13,"Canadian educated, but interested in teaching in the UK. Looking for some insight. I'm Canadian educated on the West Coast. I don't want to get into why I want to leave the area. However, I want to leave the area. **Because of this, I am exploring possibilities worldwide, and I'd love to gain some insight into how other education systems differ from the one in which I have been trained and certified.**

Canadian schools are extremely ""liberal"" in their methods - teachers have complete control over what will happen in their classroom without approval from administration, learning is more focused on overall development of the child rather than earning letter and number grades until grade eight (age 13) or later, and the atmosphere in a classroom on the West Coast is very self-paced; that is, if the class excels in one area, they can move on and devote extra time to an area that they need more work in. Mathematics now has its foundations in DBL with almost total elimination of rote memorization, and social studies (involving history, current events, and politics) is focused primarily on local indigenous (native) education with no introduction to the outside world until grades 5-6 (ages 10-12). 

I am not in any way saying that I agree philosophically these things, but these are what I understand to be the ""quirks"" of the education system that I'm brought up in and that I have been trained to teach in. **With these things in mind, how does the UK education system differ from or resemble the Canadian (BC) system?** I'm aware of international teaching opportunities in other place, particularly in Canadian curriculum schools in China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and so on. However, the UK is one area that I have started to consider as it is an English-speaking country that I am comfortable in and would be extremely happy to contribute to. One thing I do **not** care about is salary or wages. I teach to teach, I teach to change the lives of kids, not to fill my bank account. That is only a happy side effect. 

Even if you have insight from another country, I'd love to hear it. I am simply exploring the opportunities out there.",5.971378708551482,8.134817481675396,6.7670994764397925,69.22532635253057,67.90052356020942,9.910087260034905,34.19930191972077,10.203070172399654,4.022756788830716,1706,82,274,46,30,563,201,382,0.031,0.807,0.162,0.9963,5,0,1,0,0,0,70.0,0,1,4,9,8,11,0,0,21,0,29,2,0,4,1,50,46,23,0,8,12,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,2,23,16,0,1,9,0,3,5,6,0,0,5,3,3,21,11,63,39,6,59,0,0,1,2,14,39,0,8,10,196,44,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12710353236378766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08631775251796008,0.13309871404291948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07737624620293235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12941509358241976,0.0,0.13427666514031794,0.0,0.13308523171185466,0.0,0.14236443722323036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.265232741103038,0.0,0.0,0.1110785850978673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0838370390609287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06631645436567966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11224508005157913,0.2702418209823549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14306099220654536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2688041993311047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11208281383005472,0.0,0.10659046660405053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2291212154908524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12816460098007307,0.0,0.0,0.13490806516079829,0.0,0.09411807693737786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34404819734302505,0.09653710296836547,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13261637055151898,0.0,0.0,0.14309616103957898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1009409998953032,0.0,0.25692284912675223,0.0,0.0,0.13241720632216158,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12939064918638865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0898427480413842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2529828863255821,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07401476112925594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13214013713508546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10473175639515536,0.22460240971768386,0.10075229300698556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11453590908269312,0.0,0.0,0.12235740787769407,0.0,0.09240762217670448,0.0,0.0,0.0901684747098574,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,CertainlyNoPatience,2018/01/13,"Just some inspiration. I have this one incredibly difficult student. He rarely does his work, has a terrible attitude, curses out loud in class, etc. I’ve written discipline slips for him more than any other student ever. Every day, though, I smile at him and greet him when he walks in the door.  I act like nothing happened the day before. Sometimes he still shows anger toward me; sometimes he doesn’t. I figure he hates me and would love nothing more than to punch me. He is an aggressive kid all around. 

Yesterday, we had a lockdown drill. I turned off the lights and huddled everyone in the corner (a stupid response to a threat if you ask me, but that’s another post.) I  happened to be standing next to said kid. He looked up at me, I guess emboldened by the cloak of darkness, and he said, “You’re a great teacher. I’m sorry about everything. I’ve probably learned more in here than any other class.”

teaching,JMoon33,2018/01/13,"How to teach a bilingual class? Hello everyone,

I'll be teaching a group of 20 adult students where about half speak French and half speak English. It's not a language class. I'm not too sure how to make it work. I'm guessing most of the time I'll give work to do to a group while I teach the other group in a language, then change, but it still feels like there'll be some awkward moments.

teaching,N1ceCupOfTea,2018/01/13,"I have an interview Wednesday can I run my ideas by you? As I said, I have an interview on Wednesday for an NQT position starting in September. I have to do a presentation on funding (I'm ok with this) and teach a half hour session to year 3s where we will be story mapping. I've been given the text and that's it for my information, I've never met these children before. 
What I thought I might do is start of by recapping the story as a whole class, they are a Talk for Writing school so would have practised recalling the story, then split them into small groups with sugar paper to focus on aspects of the story mapping. Setting, Characters, Problem, Overcoming the problem, and Ending. Then each group feed back and I'll draw it up on a flipchart? I'll have pictures of the story around on tables for them to prompt and statements. 
Trouble is - is this too boring? Do you think it would work as a lesson? I was thinking of something drama based but I don't know the children so that feels very risky.

teaching,akmcrae,2018/01/13,"Lightbulb Moment...A Little Positivity It isn’t surprising or shocking to see that most of the posts I see here are slightly negative. Teaching is hard. In fact most days I can’t believe I’m still doing it (6th year). 

But today I saw a 1st grader with that “lightbulb moment” and it brought total joy to me for the rest of the afternoon.  “Charlie” is a bit of a trouble-maker and his own adults in his life have flat-out called him worthless in front of him. However, as I was reading a story today I asked him specifically what he thought the word “astonished” means. He got all frustrated looking and immediately said he didn’t know. But I said “Yeah you do....use the clues”. 

And he GOT IT. He sat up straight and said “SHOCKED! It means SHOCKED!” and for a split second I saw him feel empowered. 

That is what teaching is about. It sucks. It’s amazing. But at the end of the day....it’s the lightbulbs.

teaching,TRENDSETTA,2018/01/13,"When to get my masters? Hello all. My brief background - Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, three years experience teaching K-6 internationally, just finished TeacherReady and have my Florida K-6 cert, landed a great job teaching elementary Science and Math at an international school in China next year.

I realize that my situation is a bit different as an international teacher, but I appreciate your thoughts on this.

I just went to my first career fair and had surprising success, particularly with elementary STEM positions (which are relatively uncommon and must be harder to fill). I love teaching elementary and expect I'll be doing it for at least the next 10 years. Getting a master's seems to be only a positive thing in the international community, so the question for me isn't 'if' but rather 'when' and what to get it in.

I have 12 credits (a third of the degree) done already with CSU global's MS in Teaching and Learning (via TeacherReady) and the program looks good and fits my situation perfectly. This is a good time in my life for me to get it done, my school will help pay for part of it, I'll make more money, and be more competitive.

Now, the reasons for waiting:

1. I'm not sure if I want to be a homeroom teacher (loved it so far, but much more competition for jobs) or a STEM teacher (I think I'll love it, but won't know til next year). Maybe I'll discover I want to be a Math/Science/STEM specialist?
2. Somewhere down the line, probably in my old age, I suspect I'll end up in a leadership position. Should I wait til later and get a master's with a leadership component?
3. I can already find jobs easily enough and the money is already good.

So it really comes down to: should I start a general master's in teaching now when the timing's good for me and I can start reaping some of the benefits earlier on, or wait a year or two and get a more relevant, specialized degree?

teaching,guinnderella,2018/01/14,"First Year Teacher Advice Hello! I graduated in December 2017 with my BS in Elementary Education. I was recently hired to take over a 4th grade classroom due to the teacher being promoted. I graduated expecting to work as a long term sub but I am very excited for this opportunity! My first day with the students is on Tuesday.

The other 4th grade teachers have told me that the students are very sad about their previous teacher leaving. What can I do to make this transition for them as easy as possible? Also, if you have any ideas on what I can do on my first day to bond with them, please let me know. Thank you!

teaching,girlski,2018/01/14,"Tips on dealing with an EBD student? I'm a student teacher and not ready, qualified, or prepared to handle this kind of situation.

2nd grade classroom, but our new student is almost my size.

We are in a low income area so we already have challenges in our classroom. We just got a new student who is extremely violent and defiant. He has had to be restrained, I've had to physically block him from beating the shit out of another student half his size, he has thrown things at other students and myself (including chairs and scissors that he took from my desk), he's been stealing things from other students and myself. He just thrashes around and rips stuff up, destroys the classroom, and walks around in and out of the room as he pleases. He has ended up across the street before, then come back in the classroom to knock all of the stuff off my cooperating teachers desk. Out of my cooperating teachers 10 years of teaching in a title I school, this is the worst she's ever seen, and the principal with 20 years of experience has said the same.

Our other students have learned nothing since he came, we can't fit in instruction. They are also hungry for attention since he has gotten all of ours so they have started acting out too.

He is not on an IEP so we can't get him a 1-on-1 para or any special services and our special ed teacher quit before winter break. It will take several weeks at best to get him any sort of services. 

Our principal, vice principal, or behavior specialist has been in our room constantly since he got there, except for when they all have meetings about him, he goes to lunch, recess, or specialist, and they *leave me alone with him* which as a 20 day old teacher is absolutely terrifying and I am in no way qualified to take on that responsibility. Ive already had to use my planning and breaks to supervise him by myself and it's difficult and terrifying. I'm so scared of him and I feel pretty used by them. 

On Tuesday my mentor teacher will be gone which means I have to manage his behaviors and teach the whole day in front of the principal which is intimidating and I'm so nervous.

Any tips on how to handle this? I'm currently questioning my career choices and am ready to quit.

teaching,ninjia1,2018/01/15,"Looking into teaching as a career change - any advice? Hello r/teaching. I graduated in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree and I've been working in a construction company since June 2017. I don't like it: I am in the office 6:30AM-4:30PM on any regular day, I travel at least once a month from Los Angeles to San Diego and stay overnight. On average I work 50+ hours each week. And for those of you who don't know, there is no such thing as ""overtime pay"" in the architecture industry. At first I wasn't sure if I didn't like my current job or if I didn't like my career: I've interviewed with 3 other companies in the past month, and the expectations are about the same - no overtime pay, expected to stay late right before deadlines (which screams poor time management).

I have worked as a tutor since I was in the 9th grade up until I graduated from college. I loved explaining concepts to students, and I feel really good every time someone understood something. I also worked as a TA when I was in college, and I really enjoyed that experience.

I am considering teaching high school math. I know I will need to take the CBEST and the math CSET, and then start a teaching credential program. I was looking at CSULA's program- because it's cheap and I could take the bus and be there within 30 minutes. Can you please give me advice if I am going into the wrong hole? What hurdles did you have to overcome when you were getting your teaching credential? Would it be better to get a Masters in Education? How much money should I have saved up (I live with my parents) before I go back to school? 

Thank you in advance.",5.086363636363637,6.319728904458604,5.872541980312683,78.38066589461495,68.87261146496813,8.893804284887088,31.78865083960625,9.218907990703514,2.845285350318472,1292,55,238,25,22,423,179,314,0.083,0.846,0.071,0.503,3,0,1,0,0,0,41.0,0,6,0,8,9,12,0,0,18,0,27,1,0,1,1,36,45,24,0,9,4,1,1,3,0,4,0,1,0,0,10,16,0,0,5,1,5,4,7,2,0,1,10,4,35,10,40,28,4,45,1,0,2,1,13,21,0,5,21,160,45,28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2300130267807673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09411763864530924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16006815212123435,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09049729558445777,0.0,0.07174348489439655,0.0,0.2002931463735945,0.0,0.0,0.10408833387404956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12450172203881432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09396687506017028,0.0,0.0,0.07590111065469851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09915994203406636,0.0,0.0,0.11512461166363347,0.0,0.0,0.05950822498114741,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10010810493903237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12297762622280768,0.11290015739707646,0.13377328285467285,0.09871382465785604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1243472521834787,0.0,0.0,0.11590216004171006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11679039134774535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12936005046597365,0.0,0.1327608401061202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17249397880452247,0.0,0.10392351730075594,0.0,0.1976619933367761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1062209351655702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18788004294518326,0.0,0.08651659994521325,0.08726655998970555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12533732496304725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13068218939376386,0.0,0.11234960148872652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12918963475182973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507920384541448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10050767220892233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23821962746820266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19471081266920345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09971940206141887,0.09060446309296684,0.0,0.0,0.08330246236129572,0.2508863958158953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11092259680121673,0.0,0.17697832473896696,0.0,0.0,0.10835427748953316,0.0,0.0,0.07818882742574991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13725341193504176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09440481022925863,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3427224850569324,0.0,0.0,0.08360447709406034,0.12867689072638147,0.0,0.0

teaching,stupidanalysis,2018/01/15,"Currently teaching ESL in Japan, and am struggling on figuring out how to become a teacher when I return to the States I moved to Japan in 2016 after graduating with a BA in English and for the past few years I've been wanting to become teacher. As the title mentioned, I'm teaching conversational English in Japan now and was fortunate to land a job with an employer who teaches English to all age groups.

I really, really like working with young adults and when I return to the States, I'd like to become a humanities/liberal arts teacher at either a high school or, ideally, at a college. 

Right now, I am trying to figure out how to best spend my free time here in Japan so I have something to show for all the time I spent out in the wilderness, so to speak, and what to do when I inevitably return to the States.

The biggest questions I have:

* I'm having trouble convincing myself how understanding Japanese culture and being bilingual will make me a more competitive candidate for grad schools. What are your thoughts on people who spent time living/working abroad before applying to grad school?

* What Masters degree should I be looking at? A Masters in Education? A Masters in Fine Arts? Secondary Education? It's a little overhwhelming how many options there are. 

* The biggest thing I worry about is my 2.5 GPA. If you were to just look at classes I took during the last two years, my GPA was 3.2. Again, I'm having trouble convincing myself that makes any real difference as far as admissions is concerned. After all, isn't a big reason why GPA is so important for graduate programs is to see a students history in whether or not they are capable of handling the work load that accompanies the pursuit of a graduate degree? 

Thanks in advance for the help, and I'll see you all down in the comments!

teaching,allovee,2018/01/15,"Student teachers--how far in advance are you planning? Hello! 
I'm student teaching this semester. I'm working towards my single subject credential in English. I have one freshman class and two senior expository classes. For all of my classes, my master teachers have given me pacing guides and materials, but one of my master teacher wants two weeks of lesson plans in advance. 
I've been able to keep myself a few days ahead, but the other people that are student teaching at the same school haven't been lesson planning at all. We haven't started our classes at the university yet, so I don't know what the requirements are just yet. 
How far in advance should I be planning? Is my master teacher crazy asking for two weeks? What is the best way to handle this? 
I'm not overwhelmed yet, but I just want to know what's reasonable.

teaching,katiesham,2018/01/16,"How to feel prepared as an English teacher? Hi all! 

I’ve been teaching fourth grade for a year and a half in a private school, while working on my MAT in English. I minored in English in college and have always had a passion for English, but was too worried about getting a job that I didn’t go for teaching in my undergrad. 

The school where I teach has offered me a high school English position next year and I’m so excited for the opportunity. It will be great experience and can count for my student teaching portion of my degree. 

However, I’m suddenly panicked about the sheer amount of information necessary for this content area. There is endless knowledge about the various subjects within English and I suddenly feel like I could not possibly be prepared for this. How does one ever feel well-read enough to call themselves and English teacher?

Any and all advice is appreciated!

teaching,j_audreyyy,2018/01/16,"Help with students who have no desire to learn. Hello! 

This is my first year teaching, and was excited to be employed in the district that I am. I teach math and science to 50 5th graders split between two classes. 

My first class has a desire to learn, and even the ones that struggle, TRY. And I'm okay with trying, I appreciate it and I can work with it. 

My second class however, is the very opposite. They don't care for my teaching, for learning, or for trying at all. Students will come up to me and say that they don't care about what they're doing, that if they fail it's my fault not theirs. The kids will tell me that they didn't study because they didn't care. 
I had a student who OPENLY cheated on a test. I gave her a 0, after MULTIPLE chances to stop after being caught. Her mother came to the school raised cain to the principal and the kid ended up getting to retake the test, AT HOME, with help! 
So now she doesn't care about what she does because she feels there will be no consequences. 

Math is 90 minutes. When they have tests and even quizzes! they get the whole time to do it. Some kids will still hand in their test with 2 questions done and say it's my fault. 

They don't write down the notes, they don't participate in class activities, (and not for nothing I pride myself on making math a FUN subject.)

I truly don't know what to do. It breaks my heart to see some of the grades these kids are getting in my class and i'm continuously am trying to help them bump their grade up. 

They get extensions on their projects, I'll reprint homework assignments so they can do them again, let them retake tests for half credit if they get below a 70. I give them extra credit, I set up tutoring 3 times a week, I make sure to review everything with the kids before exams, I give them two weeks notice for them all. 


I don't know what to do. 
I am truly at a loss. 

I don't want to get fired at the end of the year for a low grade average. 

I really don't know what to do. 
The principal is no help, I actually go out of my way to avoid her. 
The union rep is no help.

teaching,PemberleyCoast,2018/01/17,"Helicopter parents are crushing my spirit Third year teacher here, I used to teach Kindergarten at a Title I school and now work as a kindergarten teacher in a very affluent area. It has been great having parents involved (donations for supplies, interest in school events, etc.) The issue is that some of my parents are a little TOO involved. I have a few parents that are emailing me more than once a day on the regular about pretty much everything. Some of my students are struggling to follow expectations, but when I talk to parents it’s nothing but excuses... they don’t want to provide consequences since they are young, but they don’t realize that taking care of these problems for their kids is leading to entitled behavior. I don’t feel like I can build accountability with the current relationship I have with some of these parents and honestly having them non-stop contacting me about things that are not big issues is wearing me out. How do I stop this cycle?

I am a first year teacher in an urban school in central Illinois. I moved down here from the Chicago suburbs as this was the only school to offer me a job after I graduated. For financial reasons I am more or less forced to get a job back up where I am from so I can stay with my parents for a year while saving money to pay off my student debt.

I would appreciate some advice on how I should ask for a letter of recommendation from my evaluator. Him and I have a very good working relationship and has had good things to say about me following formal and informal observations. Should I expect the request to jeopardize the rapport I have built with administration?

teaching,tdreeves,2018/01/17,"Help! Student Research Project about U.S. K-12 Classroom Teachers Subject: Research Opportunity for U.S. K-12 Teachers

Dear Teachers,
 
You are invited to participate in a research study for U.S. K-12 teachers entitled Teachers' Use of Non-Academic Data for Decision-Making Purposes, being conducted by Todd Reeves, a faculty member, and Kayla Scheel, an undergraduate student, at Northern Illinois University. The purpose of the study is to examine access to, and analysis, interpretation, and use of non-academic data among U.S. K-12 in-service teachers. 
 
The study will involve completion of an online survey about your access to, and analysis, interpretation, and use of non-academic data in the school context in which you work, your beliefs about data-driven decision making, and your professional and demographic characteristics. The online survey should take about 20 minutes to complete, and any information you provide will not be shared with the school or district in which you work. 
 
If you choose to participate in the study, you will be able to enter into a drawing for 1 of 3 Apple TVs. 
 
The survey and more information about the study can be accessed here: https://niu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6seKc0XcjuYTN3v The survey is best completed on a personal computer (e.g., laptop, desktop), rather than a cell phone/mobile device.
 
We would be grateful if you would participate in our study. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely,

teaching,kv87689,2018/01/17,"Does anyone use a keystone assignment in their classroom for assessment? I am starting to teach an alternate course at the high school level. It is through IB so they have their own methods of examining students, but since I am preparing them for college I was thinking of switching from test-based assessment and incorporating a keystone assessment for all or some of my formative assessments. Has anyone tried anything like this? I brought it up to an administrator who seemed intrigued by the idea. My problem is I am moving from College Preparatory and Honors classes to this advanced course and I am afraid that their grades would be too inflated if not given normal test assessments because this would be much more subjective. 

When I say keystone assignment, I am thinking of projects I had in my education courses in college that had us compile different components overtime to produce one major work. This would be graded by a rubric.

Today they took their middle of the year STAR reading test, and they blew it out of the water. I was sooo nervous!

teaching,bridiacuaird,2018/01/18,"Your professional response to a parent who firmly states that their child never lies? There's always that parent, who has that undying conviction that their child can do no wrong. Now, the scenario I went through this week was by no means serious, but this is what the parent said to me following a disciplinary action I took against her teen (sent the teen to the office for continuing to speak at the same time as me). Mother's stance: she wasn't the only one talking and every one of them should have been sent to the office. The mother basically said she 100% disagreed with my decision. Her daughter has been giving me attitude for weeks but of course I've been letting it slide and the mother was not made aware of it. In any case, her daughter was the one *instigating* those conversations in class, even after multiple warnings from me.

I want to come across as civil, obviously, but I also am just fed up with parents being so entitled. I can just imagine this mother bashing my decision openly in front of her kid, who then will continue to disrespect me in class. And then next time I feel like disciplining her, I'll be thinking twice because of the shark of a mother she has. 

What is the best way to respond, and deal with this in the future? My admin is aware and finds it just as irritating as me.

teaching,mssxx,2018/01/18,"Looking for any ideas to store student portfolios online. Hi r/teaching,

This is my first semester teaching ESL online after many years of face to face instruction. I now use Moodle as my main way of sending out instructor information and sending out assignments and homework.

The mandate by the government who funds the program requires students to have a portfolio. In face to face instruction, this was easily done by giving students a binder.

Do any teachers have any ideas on how to store portfolios online? I am wondering if something exists where I can post work for students to complete, and then at the end have an option to download the students work into a zip file or PDF. Is this wishful thinking?!

Google Docs is not an option with my school for some reason.",6.69913043478261,8.557127318840582,6.3804057971014485,73.8975652173913,65.66666666666666,8.998260869565216,36.26376811594203,9.3871,3.777432463768117,622,31,95,12,10,194,90,138,0.0,0.959,0.041,0.6654,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,10,0,11,4,4,3,0,23,17,8,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,7,0,1,6,0,6,2,1,0,0,1,2,1,6,0,23,15,2,17,0,0,1,0,6,7,0,6,6,67,10,17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4002642185715221,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20570992918855927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20077873008775898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1737732431984348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16688596644654735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18821105334731086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4429674484681709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16475695353462416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1989140345684146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18790350376717266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20172427859911607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.198562907472773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1510428490964745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12571579233589208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16945212673399515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1557328848096811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2256180820561876,0.0,0.21276842279022945,0.2856690433632805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12634511564033812

teaching,emphoria,2018/01/18,"Concerns about student teaching I am going to start student teaching next week in an elementary school. My biggest concern is being able to complete an entire week of lesson plans on time (after I have been eased into taking complete control of the day). I have to have the lessons turned in the Thursday before the next week begins. My university requires our lesson plans to be quite detailed, so it takes me a lot of time to complete one plan. Any elementary teachers have any tips, recommendations, or advice for taking on the workload? I plan on getting help from my mentor teacher as well.

teaching,_Ardhan_,2018/01/18,"I need help with a student/teacher/parents problem, and I'm on a deadline Not so much bad parenting (since I can't confirm it), but rather what I consider *horrible* teaching practices in school that led to me being (lightly) stabbed.

I'm studying to become a teacher and am currently an ""intern"" at a school (don't know the proper English word for it, but we're a handful of students who are placed into a school for six weeks each year as part of our education). We're currently in a 2nd grade class.

Anyway, on our first day we are told by the teacher assigned to us that she has a student who must be handled... gently. He is completely uninterested in school, wanders around the classroom doing whatever he wants, including disturbing the other students, even having full conversations with them *while* we're trying to teach. He doesn't respond to requests, instructions or criticism, and if you try to stop him from being disruptive, he resists - often violently. And if you have the audacity to actually physically direct or restrain him - woooh, you're in for a treat.

When I ask what methods they've tried with him, ""our"" teacher makes it pretty obvious that their handling of this student was quickly boiled down to ""let's not piss him off, because he will cry for an hour if necessary"", and so they give us a standing ""order"" to simply leave him be and only intervene when he is actively disrupting others. Which is constantly. This ""soft"" approach is emulated by every teacher in the school, so he basically has free reign, and the other 2nd graders have made note of it, leading to other students acting similarly.

Anyways, this week I got to finally spend some proper time with him, after two weeks of only observing, and today he decided he wanted to go outside and play in the snow. During class. Something he announces to everyone around him. So off he goes, and I follow, after getting permission from my teacher to try to handle him. I've had my suspicions for a while about why he acts the way he does, so I'm happy to finally get the chance to test my theory.

I stop him as he's zipping up his jacket, telling him we need to finish class before we go outside. I've built up a really good rapport with him over the previous two days by incorporating the subject we're teaching (fairytales) into a simplified game of D&amp;D/Blades in the Dark, which he thought was awesome, while it also allowed me to ""sneak"" my teaching into the game so that he got most of what the rest of the class was getting in the other room (oh yeah, if you want to get ANYTHING done, he apparently has to have his own room to ""work"" in). This rapport meant nothing now, though, as I gently told him that no, he could not go outside because he ""was going to"".

This... annoyed him.

He started small by whining and moaning while pushing weakly at me to get away from the door leading outside. I told him we had to stay inside, but that if he just told me he was going to go back to class, I would even go in first, because I trusted him (this [the trust part] was a lie, I'll admit). He refuses to answer, instead ramping up his shitty behavior by now pushing me hard and trying to bend my fingers. I close my fist so that he lets go and tell him not to do that. He continues, so I firmly lift him three feet away from me, which pisses him off. He comes back swinging, and I meet his fist with a light open-hand slap (to his fist) that halts the punch, which makes him pause. I'm still completely calm, as this really is just an issue of correcting his behavior by calmly showing him the consequences of his actions, in my opinion, and I tell him that he is not allowed to do that, and if he does it, people will do the same to him, which I don't like or want to do, ""let's be friends again, please"".

He resumes pushing at me, but now also throws in a barrage of angry punches and begins pinching and scratching me, so I give him a light, but firm push away from me, so that he's at arm's length again. I give him what I hope is a sad, sympathetic smile and tell him I don't like what we're doing right now, and that no one should be pushing or pinching or punching, or shoving, for that matter, but that I am NOT going to let him just hurt me like that. All while concentrating on being completely calm, as I think aggression is what really harms a child the most, not necesarily the use of a certain amount of force. If you remain calm and don't allow yourself to get angry, or at least to *show it*, I think a child who doesn't ""get"" verbal instructions regarding their violent behavior, might understand the ""action--&gt;consequences"" part of it when you respond by, say, pushing them away if they try something violent. Not all kids, but some.

Anyway, at this point he takes a step closer and tells me he is going to bring a gun to school (""I have one at home"") that he will shoot me in the eye with, and that he'll stab me with a knife. I respond ""no"" and hold out my hand in a ""stop"" motion when he takes another step. He stops and regards me, unsure what to do. He's forgotten how angry he is, for the moment, but is quickly working that out in his head. I tell him I will move as soon as he confirms that he will return to class, because I trust him.

So he stabs me in the chest with a pencil.

It's a quick overhand stab that, thankfully, doesn't penetrate my skin, and I push him to the ground before he can get another one in, but I decided then that I was DONE with this shit. I tell him in my calmest furious tone that he will *not* do that again, and yank the pencil out of his hand and toss it in the trash before going down to one knee and grabbing him in what was basically a reverse bear hug. At this point he goes through an escalation of emotion similar to what I'd just seen over the past fifteen minutes, but within the span of seconds. He pushes, punches, pinches and scratches, before finally starting to howl, with tears and everything.

Thing is, *anyone* who has *ever* worked in a kindergarden knows this type of crying. It's the fakest, most forced howling I've ever heard. The only thing giving it such ""force"" is the intensity he puts into it. And it's at this point I realize that all of this shitty behavior of his is simply a tool he uses to get his way - confirming my suspicions. At least to the best of my limited knowledge, granted, but I'm confident of it. I've noticed him constantly monitoring us adults whenever he acts out, gauging for our reactions, and this is exactly the same, except it's his trump card. So, once I feel certain that I haven't actually hurt him (I was *really* careful - I believe in a limited, rare use of force in certin instances, never as punishment or something reactionary), I simply turn off my brain and ignore him, thinking of the D&amp;D campaign I'm planning nowadays, while telling him calmly that I will not let go until he tells me what we should do here. But he persists.

Then, suddenly, there's a hand on my shoulder, and another reaching for the boy. It's one of the assistants who often spends alone time with him. She smiles apologetically at me and mutters something about having to go, then grabs him and repeats herself, at which point I hear what she says, that she had offered to take him. Before I can object, she has already asked him if they should go to the play room, at which point he instantly calms down and comes with her without a fight. I was left dumbfounded and absolutely furious at myself for not speaking up and stopping her, but it was too late, and my whole effort was wasted. I was fucking *stabbed* for nothing.

At least I feel confident now as to what his problem is: adults. WE are the problem, not him. He's a pretty normal kid, and smart about the things that interest him. Our teacher has never seen him finish a full session of teaching (45 minutes), yet I kept him talking about fairytales (during D&amp;D), various ships (he LOVES ships, especially the *Titanic*, and wants to be a shipwright) and even god damn atoms and electrons for two whole hours without even moving from his seat. The kid *gets it*, but for now only when presented through a fun medium. So no, the problem is *us*, and what signals we're sending.

His problem is that no one sets any boundaries for him, or presents consequences to his shitty actions. I've asked our teacher about his parents, who claim that ""he's perfectly fine at home"", which indicates to me that he is allowed to do whatever he wants, despite his parents otherwise being good, seemingly responsible people. The way he talks himself also indicates this. This, of course, makes our job as teachers much harder (if true). But even if parents fail at boundaries, we must be consistent in enforcing them, so as to give the kids a predictable everyday life.

This is not what our school does, and I'm unsure how to handle it - to the degree that I should get further involved at all. Instead of uniting in correcting his behavior and sending him a clear message, the agreed upon strategy between ALL the 2nd grade teachers is to allow him to roam freely and do his own thing (not learning shit), even walk into *other* classrooms and wander around there as well. It's absolute mayhem, and even though they admit that he is WAY behind everyone else on the curriculum(?) and simply cannot be evaluated in several subjects due to his load of incomplete work/attendance, they still aren't changing *their own* behavior.

I've seen how smart he is, and how he *is* able to sit still for extended periods, but his wiring is such now that he's ""allergic"" to doing what he's supposed to do, and I think he's simply rejected school in general as something he just doesn't ""get"" or needs to participate in. I firmly believe that it's *our* fault, but I don't know how to broach this or how to propose a plan to change our strategy. Me and my group of fellow students are only here for three more weeks, so our influence is limited, but I *really* want there to be a change in how they deal with this kid. He deserves better.

teaching,nhalltx,2018/01/19,"Teacher wanting career switch I have been teaching for 5 years in the inner city. I entered the profession through Teach For America. I do not have a teaching license, so I am pretty much stuck at terrible charter schools that treat the kids like prisoners. I once loved it, I think I outgrew it or I just hit ""the wall."" The thought of entering the classroom sends me into a breakdown. I was quite successful in the classroom, I am just done. I left my job in August and I have been unemployed since but applying to jobs daily.

I just finished my masters at Columbia and I am desperate for a career switch. I am wondering if any of you work in education, but in non-classroom or non-school jobs.

Anyone switch careers completely? Where did you go? Any switch into something related? Anyone in Ed Tech?

teaching,fairlywittyusername,2018/01/19,"So, I'm a certified teacher that recently started teaching English online, and it's actually been a great additional revenue stream. Hey all,

Just thought I'd pass this along. I taught for the last few years abroad in Turkey, and loved it, but since I've moved back to Canada I've been focusing on my freelance writing career. I missed teaching though, and recently started teaching with VIP KID back in December, and I've actually really enjoyed it. I thought maybe some fellow teachers might as well.

In short, you teach kids in China English in 25 minute class segments. You get paid per hour, so essentially every 2 classes that you're booked for. The popular hours are essentially 5-9am Eastern time, and I usually teach 4-5 classes a morning before moving on to my freelance writing and all that. But you can also teach on weekends and that - basically just when kids aren't at school, so apparently the summer is great for work.

Anyway, based on your experience and interview, you get paid 14-22 bucks USD per hour, plus there's a load of incentives. Basically, you get extra money for every kid you teach, plus there are tiers. So if I teach over 44 classes per month, I get an extra dollar per class and so on and so forth.

As a male, I've also found that male teachers are pretty high in demand. Anyway, I figured I'd post here and you can feel free to ask questions.

Here's a referral link: https://t.vipkid.com.cn/activity/popup?refereeId=9918124&amp;refersourceid=a01 and here's a non referral link - https://t.vipkid.com.cn/

If you have questions, don't hesitate. I've taught about 50 classes, so I'm not a huge expert, but I'd like to think I could answer some questions you might have.",6.224051699099622,7.76174058466454,6.3202977054893985,75.08952584954984,66.47603833865816,9.013592796979381,31.799157711298285,9.339509955726095,2.9246626198083066,1365,55,236,26,22,434,167,313,0.024,0.816,0.161,0.9927,1,0,0,0,0,0,64.0,0,10,0,1,24,9,0,0,12,0,15,1,0,0,2,46,35,32,0,3,8,0,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,6,9,17,0,0,12,2,6,3,3,1,1,0,9,1,20,9,29,23,8,38,0,1,0,1,26,17,0,9,18,133,29,21,0.0,0.0,0.22194811638745288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1818832637947011,0.0,0.12321528658524915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1063126022455846,0.0,0.0,0.17488691516715307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09676711959229227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0907959558406562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19162756476305026,0.0,0.0,0.11123972304166367,0.0,0.0,0.05750011548308163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1246878209890152,0.0,0.0,0.23765547407562224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2507528210985177,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12015114486810954,0.0,0.0,0.3359730989748857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09269676291694283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555771886736944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10263650177225377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1142467599140028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2412773381060884,0.0,0.0,0.0907700084293967,0.2417321650341963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10891207217402983,0.1156938546273264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3821763913495243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07285177492514269,0.0,0.22456904035436745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11509044417051455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0940701408740624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1609828290901648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07286701511041252,0.11172906336108604,0.1805615357388552,0.06631089264729488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12524622314388734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10224769997214343,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0827893222981592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07323178161971376
teaching,otakupuppy,2018/01/19,"Teaching English to Beginners Hi I am 19/M. I was recently offered the opportunity to teach English to 6th graders after school at the school I used to study. Since our school only offers English medium learning from grade 6 onwards and not before students they do study English as a language but other subjects in the native tongue that is Sinhala. Most students go to tutors and figure it out but the kids coming from rural areas who stay in the hostel can't do that (or afford it and the school can't afford teachers to come to teach for  them so the alumnis had to take this) so this class is aimed at them.

I am fairly okay with English but I am worried that I am not good at teaching (haven't taught anyone in an official capacity bin my life) and I have no idea where to start or what to teach them just grammar or just spoken. They say there could be max 50 kids and I don't know whether I can handle so much. Any advice is much appreciated.

teaching,cara1123,2018/01/20,"Student Teacher Issue Hello all,
I am looking for feedback about an issue with student teachers I'm wondering if any other teachers are seeing.

I am in my eighth year of teaching English/Journalism at a large high school.  I work with a very talented department, and although I am certainly not the best English teacher in my school, I work very hard and have received accolades during my time there.  I also work well with people and hold several leadership positions in my school and district.

Our local university always asks teachers in our district to take on student teachers, and since I work at one of the four traditional high schools in the area, I always feel like we need to represent and take a few.  After nobody offered to take one this year (after a bad experience with one last year), I decided to have another go.  I had a great experience with a student teacher a few years ago, and I firmly believe it's important for veteran teachers to mentor newbies.  

I interviewed this person (they are 23; I'm 33) in May, and they seemed to be very confident.  I was very clear about expectations, and this person seemed to be 100% on board.  I also gave them some resources to study over the summer and all of our major texts to read.

In August, they came to every beginning of year inservices with me and started observing me the first day of school.  They met staff members and were treated well by all. They observed me three full days a week, and as the fall semester continued, I noticed they did not really seem very engaged or motivated.  They were there when they were supposed to be, but they never took notes or seemed motivated to get involved.  I brought their college observer (the mom of one of the best teachers in our department and 30-year veteran teacher) into the mix, and after she observed them a few times, we came up with a ""game plan"" on how to improve this person so they'd be ready to take over the classroom in January.

I have to add in at this point that the student teacher has a very awkward and closed personality and is not natural in the classroom.  This is the type of person who will say they are OK when they aren't because they think that's what you want to hear.  They are also the type of person that is afraid to ask questions and will not take chances.  In other words, this person isn't a natural in the classroom.  They did form some really strong bonds with students, and we worked on getting this person to open up to us about what they needed.  

Their observer and I gave so much feedback on lessons and really took time to help this person.  We did different activities to give them experience and really tried to capitalize on their skills.  Additionally, I have really great classes this year--small class sizes, wonderful students, and a good schedule.  There was so much support, and this person grew a lot in four months of observing and occasionally teaching.

Because the student teacher watched me for over four months, his observer and I decided to have them start off the semester.  We thought that because they often seemed complacent and even lazy, this might help motivate them.  We asked repeatedly if this was a good plan, and the student teacher confidentially answered yes each time.  I also came up with a curriculum plan for January, gave this person plenty of materials, and did some other things to prepare them.  Mind you, they already knew most of the students.  They seemed excited and almost relieved they were finally taking over the classroom.

Over winter break, I contacted the student teacher many times asking them if they were ready, and they always said yes.  On the first day of school, they did seem ready, but as the week continued, I noticed they seemed to fall back into that complacency.  They also seemed like they just didn't want to be there.  I figured that was because, as everyone knows, your first week of student teaching is stressful and hectic.  I repeatedly asked this person if they were OK or needed anything, and they said no.  I also helped out during lessons and interjected when needed, but I did not hover.  

Tuesday this week they came in and seemed to be fine but then did not come Wednesday and Thursday because they said they were ""sick.""  Yesterday they came in and said they needed to talk to me.  They said they felt they were overloaded and felt like they could not teach the classes I gave them.  I asked plenty of questions to get to the root of the problem, and I said I was confused as to how they felt overloaded as I've given them plenty of materials and they already saw me teach one of my semester classes once.  I also told them they weren't putting in enough time (this person usually gets to school after I do and leaves before I do).  They claimed they were working very hard at home, but they just felt like they couldn't catch up.  I was trying to be empathetic, so I told them I would take away one of their preps and then teach another class which repeats three times the first time so they could watch me.  I was going to put some extra supports in place to ensure their success.  This person did not seem satisfied with this arrangement, so after further questioning, they revealed to me they just aren't into teaching and hate it.  This was the first time I'd ever heard this from this person.  All along they told me how badly they wanted to teach and how excited they were.

After speaking with this person at length some more and trying to make them consider all sides of the issue (time and money spent in the education program, the fact that student teaching is difficult and everyone has tough weeks, etc.), I just sent them home because they were a mess and told them they needed to figure it out this weekend so I could plan ahead for Monday's classes if needed.  It didn't take them long to come to a conclusion--they emailed me last night and told me they plan on quitting.

I also called their education professor and let them know about the situation (this is before they decided they wanted to quit for sure).  She was shocked as this person spoke with her the day before, and although she was aware this person needed to back off a bit, they said everything was going great and they wanted to continue student teaching.

The last thing I want is for someone to go into teaching when they aren't passionate about it, and I'm kind of relieved this person quit because I'm not sure they ever would have been natural or a good teacher even with all of our coaching and encouragement.  But one of the things this person told me when I asked them why they weren't enjoying student teaching is ""It isn't what I thought it would be.""  This person watched me for four months, saw me plan lessons, went to every meeting possible, etc., and they came to this conclusion after 5 days teaching solo.  What did they think it would be?  Did they think it's just an easy gig with summer and breaks off?  Were they unaware of the fact that some days are good, some days are bad, but it always takes work?

I guess I am disheartened by the quality of people we have coming from teaching programs.  I know people aren't going into teaching right now for the obvious reasons, but almost every student teacher candidate we receive seems ill-prepared, lazy, and shocked when they see the work it takes to teach.  We had a science student teacher quit in the middle of the semester this year, and she just couldn't hack it after seeing how many hours we put in.  My student teacher always seemed very complacent and rarely excited or motivated.  That is also a personality thing, but they didn't really seem to care to get better.

So, are we stuck with shitty teacher candidates with a few bright lights here and there?  What can educators do to recruit the best and brightest even though there are obvious reasons for awesome people going in to the career.  We can't fix low teacher pay or the way we're vilified by the public and politicians, so what do we have control over?  I don't think I will ever take another student teacher again, and I hate feeling this way.  I love my job and I know it matters, and I want to help other people make a difference in the lives of kids.

teaching,boringbrunettebitch,2018/01/20,"Stay or leave? I’m an English teacher who’s been teaching at a great school for two years. I’m now a permanent member of staff and about start my third year teaching. This year, I’ve been trusted with teaching a high level senior English class and been given much more responsibility (and a higher pay). 

At the same time, i just came back from an overseas trip throughout Europe and I really want to go back and spend more time there. I did some research and contacted an agency that told me that I could teach casually in London and work in a flexible way that allows me to travel as I please while still earning money. 

I really want to do this! But at the same time, I’ve been given a great opportunity to teach high level English (a two year course) which would look incredible on my resume and give me great career boosting experience.

I’m 25 and I feel as though if I wait 2 years before I go overseas to teach, I’ll be too old. 
I feel like by 27, I should be really getting my act together (married, babies etc..) and I won’t have time to move overseas and galavant around Europe having fun.

Should I stay? 
Go?

teaching,Colin92541,2018/01/20,"Retention Rate? Hello all,

I’m a preservice teacher, and I gave my students a fairly easy quiz regarding the American Revolution today. We finished the unit back in December before Winter Break. At the end of the unit my classes had an 87% pass rate with an average score of 83%. I was thrilled!

Today, however, was a nightmare. It has been exactly one month since the unit summative, and I only had a 40% pass rate today. 

I’m feeling pretty discouraged and am beginning to second guess my strategies for assessment.

teaching,SomedayInLove,2018/01/21,"Social Justice MS or HS in CO/TX? I am a student teacher looking for jobs for the next year. I am considering moving to CO or TX since CA is so expensive. I was wondering if anyone knew any schools that matched the following or something similar: 

* Large Latinx Population 
* Social Justice Oriented 
* Serves mainly free and reduced lunch 
* Community oriented 

I'm a ELA teacher that speaks Spanish. I am more than willing to reach out to the schools and try to find out if any positions will be opening up.

teaching,CoffeeCatsAndBooks,2018/01/22,"Is it my school? Or is it everywhere? I work at a private residential and day school. It seems every couple of weeks I am dealing with suicidal students or students who have severe mental issues or recurring traumas. I can’t help but wonder if this is specific to my school and the types of students we are letting in or if it is the state of adolescence these days. I love teaching and I love my content area, but I feel my mental health draining away and my quality-of-life draining away with each instance I deal with. It seems every couple weeks I’m referring a student to therapists on campus or calling in concerns about abuse or other mental health issues and dangers. 

Is this the nature of a residential school? Do these kinds of schools attract students with major psychological files and health needs? Do day schools face the same kinds of issues? I feel some weeks I’m dealing with mental health issues more than I’m in the classroom teaching. I can’t be a teacher and a watchdog and be a functioning human being outside of school. I feel pulled in so many directions.

I have considered leaving on more than one occasion but I don’t know if it’s a “grass is always greener” situation or if a new day environment without the boarding component would really make a difference for me as a teacher and a person.

I know a refugee family whose 11 years old daughter still cannot read after 2 years of attending school in Canada. She is a refugee from a war-torn country and has spent age 4 to 9 in war before coming to Canada. Her parents don't know the language good enough to help her.

I feel like I need to help her, 11 years old is pretty old for not knowing how to read yet.

Any tips on how to do it?",5.2567021276595725,4.205708712765958,5.9271063829787245,86.05300000000004,68.25531914893618,8.796595744680852,29.43829787234043,7.554174236665415,1.5175089361702123,345,10,79,3,5,113,61,94,0.042,0.809,0.149,0.8442,1,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,0,5,3,1,0,5,0,6,0,0,3,0,11,13,4,1,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,4,3,1,2,3,1,0,0,1,1,7,2,14,12,1,17,0,0,0,0,10,3,0,0,13,42,9,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09831253101835992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12301838875921335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12453422033165075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14937941573473676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13628769286586606,0.0,0.07309891614011442,0.10328080904917183,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12125842424002085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.193804394954274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23835560925961724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0706295804504398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10719679426742587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6068074192807086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1605278330269078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1470796242108048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43382725115604215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14631251878832033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11545375763042685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3723932599742832

teaching,ScooterScotward,2018/01/23,"Idea for where to buy rhyming dictionaries. Howdy, first year US history teacher teaching 8th grade in a rural, low tech school. For a summative assessment on our early US politics unit, I'm finishing with a project where students write a dialogue, response paper, or rap battle (ala the Hamilton cabinet battles). I was hoping originally to let students use our laptop cart to look up rhyming words; problem is, 2 of the 32 computers are working. 

Lab is booked out with science and math support classes so a one day in the lab to find rhyming words is not really feasible. I'm thinking of biting the bullet and picking up some physical rhyming dictionaries for students to use. Problem is, not sure where to look, and it's about an hour ""down the hill"" to the nearest city with a wide selection of shopping. Any ideas on good stores that might have cheap, (potentially used) rhyming dictionaries?",8.56557638888889,8.883993793750003,7.937083333333334,69.82180555555556,61.0625,11.361111111111116,42.77777777777778,10.980518767755715,5.004694444444444,717,40,117,17,9,225,109,160,0.075,0.873,0.052000000000000005,-0.3944,0,0,0,0,0,0,24.0,4,0,0,2,5,9,2,0,13,0,9,0,0,5,1,28,19,5,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,7,0,0,4,3,4,0,2,5,0,2,1,2,5,4,25,16,1,21,0,1,2,0,5,14,0,4,7,67,7,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11213859423219344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10634774921414164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15071687538885345,0.1402650309926677,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13831145523603172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16378427973234727,0.16239464407270926,0.0,0.0,0.3723071760382664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.168622835148858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27695125822569944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17493430678274866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11174144388820703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3155767036444613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10564004762700983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1668890018956949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1871281337280878,0.15541760067863922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10566214693618113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39671211670977735,0.4272655451061569,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12005016980810745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10619108327925468

teaching,ZombieJesus262,2018/01/23,"High School Teaching issue (PA) Hi everyone,

I have an issue with my daughters high school and thought this would be a good place to ask for advice. This may be lengthy.

Situation: 17 year old daughter is enrolled in a PA public high school. It is her junior year and she was enrolled in a Algebra II math class. After the first week of school their teacher had ""personal issues"" and left the school. They initially had a short term substitute teacher (not certified to teach high school math). At first the school made it seem the teacher was not going to be absent for an extended amount of time. The substitute teacher was unable to teach the material to the students. Our daughter told us that she would put problems on the board and ask the students to work through them at their desk. When asked questions she was unable to show the students how to solve the problems or answer most of the students other questions.

Stupidly my wife and I kept quiet thinking the teacher would return after a week at most. The teacher did not return. The principal assured the parents they were hiring a certified math teacher. Several more weeks go by and the principal states that they have hired someone that will start the following Monday (its already mid-late October). Monday comes and the substitute is still ""teaching the class"". The principal claims that the person they hired did not show up to work and states they are looking at other applicants. This goes on through the rest of the semester. No teacher was hired and the students received a grade of ""P"" for the class.

They have now been told by the principal that they may take the final for the Algebra II class whenever they feel ready. Once they take the test they will receive that grade for the year.

The principal has offered after school tutoring (45 minutes, 4 days a week) by the basketball coach. Come to find out the coach is certified high school math teacher. He also offered them to take an after school credit recovery program for the class. Credit recovery is for when a student fails a class and needs to make up the credit instead of attending summer school. They said that they will not put them into a regular Algebra II class for the next semester (they have several other Algebra II classes with an average class size of 20 students).

It may also be important to note that the principal never contacted parents that there was an issue. The only reason we knew was from our daughter. We would then have to contact the principal for updates about the situation.

We are concerned about the upcoming SAT's, what this will look like on her transcripts (if a college sees credit recovery it seems to say the student failed the class), and concerned because she deserves to have a decent education.

Basically I am looking for information. Is there a way to force the school to enroll my daughter into a regular full time math class?

Our other thought was having the school pay for a tutor of our choice that can work with our daughters schedule (weekends or nights).

Do we have to accept the after school programs and force our daughter to go? 45 minutes of tutoring does not equate a full time class to us. A couple notes on this. Our daughter also works after school to pay for her own car and insurance and this would have an impact on her ability to do this and save for college.

Are there any other options/resources for us short of suing the school district? Is that an option?

Thank you for your help! I know this was a lot of questions and wall of text so thanks for sticking in there.

I may also post this to education and legal subreddits.",6.824279701147006,7.928119155354451,6.38796169630643,76.72629274965801,64.83710407239819,9.304696762425902,34.27229997544635,9.411308987883313,3.259084212003227,2892,125,488,52,43,897,264,663,0.032,0.902,0.065,0.9665,2,0,0,0,0,0,68.0,14,2,18,8,17,16,1,0,74,0,56,0,0,4,2,77,91,29,0,9,9,13,1,1,0,13,0,3,0,2,31,29,0,1,16,5,6,12,8,5,0,2,24,8,50,11,86,50,10,84,0,2,4,0,78,29,0,16,40,351,81,76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0448491629600495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05064751611115842,0.1468124609148086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03121093939623555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1287200463332531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027977852301534826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07907089692976632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05078319025085833,0.0,0.029599204255903993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04016400898514799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043855715047026164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02320646023398124,0.0,0.0,0.050276962440303066,0.04194822751221036,0.07807844233642883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825147792392356,0.038495492802759164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030763205681849055,0.24245888395385096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1916145246325644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025223310457970074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049866274983168174,0.0,0.0,0.022422528768062576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11562355933803845,0.0,0.0,0.0390192449029464,0.0,0.043428023963624635,0.03063602036764855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034031395740656355,0.035397921631328474,0.0,0.04881105047947408,0.043070404984160315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048160263478567694,0.04887787610048886,0.0,0.03490607183738815,0.0,0.0,0.10192443254413168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08014945352295215,0.04795168297936117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04395580166531629,0.0,0.0,0.08783278798659516,0.0,0.09227656606876901,0.15424249418818506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047188861321972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043657725752674494,0.036498441379972366,0.0,0.7431892735561915,0.03657327007938761,0.08356421839956825,0.0,0.10369911670568308,0.0,0.0,0.10317833676618672,0.0,0.0,0.03888763846052939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03248551407461009,0.0,0.03665270535856695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10352452429809304,0.0,0.0,0.0845099726143482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02940838421491937,0.0,0.07287279449279045,0.08028720014059923,0.0,0.0,0.08771143009405231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1656221649266924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03643020837942351,0.14726041485363714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336517048405428,0.0,0.0,0.16301645475736867,0.0,0.0,0.08866680077476635
teaching,LarrehHoovah,2018/01/23,"White People Teaching in the Hood I recently read the book ""For White People Who Teach in the Hood..."" by Chris Emdin. It is a deeply challenging book, and really makes me wonder about my own practices. I feel like my black and Hispanic students are so smart and capable but their engagement and scores generally speaking just aren't there. I want to turn to Emdin's ideas in some sense but I also feel like his methods wouldn't develop critical thinking, literacy and writing very well. Has anyone read the book? What do you think? Do you have your own thoughts for white suburban people teaching in poorer urban areas?",4.935663716814162,7.441790221238942,4.898415929203542,80.06992477876106,71.56637168141594,8.413805309734514,28.1141592920354,9.120678840339163,2.6190502654867265,497,19,85,11,10,154,79,113,0.038,0.79,0.172,0.9339,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,0,3,1,1,6,6,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,1,0,21,17,9,0,2,3,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,5,0,0,7,5,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,7,12,6,10,15,3,6,0,0,4,0,8,5,0,2,3,53,15,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16657092160944642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14564250840984092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21063724124672412,0.2976074864112644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2351361515157612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20352175876285036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1390364309756014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4332100386914063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4166964445181963,0.0,0.13343709626700148,0.0,0.20566307881410328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2669300211276389,0.0,0.16536046686069167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2265617262990352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17186259489580105,0.12285593304444513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18727939296306265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2258836321810123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,AzraelHyo,2018/01/23,"PGCE maths student, although I doubt for much longer I'm at a loss. I'm training on a PGCE course but I'm at a point where I'm just going to quit. And this terrifies me because I've wanted to be a teacher for a long time, I don't have any idea what I can move onto doing. 
Behaviour management is what I struggle most with and I have observed numerous lessons a D picked up on numerous methods for dealing with behaviour but my subject mentor is never happy. And the things they tell me to do conflict massively with what I observe in every lesson I go to. I try my utter hardest and I feel at this point they've given up on me. I feel completely in the dark and they just seem content to complain about me and watch me crash and burn at the end of my placement. I desperately wanted to be a teacher and I just feel like the support I needed has been non existent. I'm back in therapy, I spend most evenings hiding under my bed wishing things would just end and I remain far too meek to even try and bring my problems up with the university. Which has ultimately left me in the position when I'm almost certain to fail. Another year of my life wasted. I'm lost. Just completely lost.

teaching,Icanrightgood,2018/01/24,"How different is teaching from subbing? I’m a long-term sub in a tenth grade classroom. I just started this week and am facing the usual bumps and bruises (not literally), but this isn’t my first time in the classroom. 

As I push back against what kids try to get away with, I’m wondering how close this is to real teaching. 

For anyone that’s made the jump from sub to fill time, what are the main differences? Are you happier with a full time role?

I wanted to start it out by having each teacher create a document to introduce her class as a whole. I'm looking for some sort of template to create this. I was also thinking that the whole class could work together to write the first letter to introduce themselves. Does anyone have any experience with introducing penpal projects to their classes?

teaching,destiny-jr,2018/01/24,"I'm about to start teaching middle schoolers with zero training and I would love some advice. I know this is kind of a strange post but I really need help.

I'm not teaching full time or anything. I'm an Italian student at the university level and one of my professors pulled me aside after class to ask me a favor. Another student has been teaching at a local middle school as a kind of internship gig but she can't do it on Thursdays and he desperately needs someone to take up the slack.  

I agreed, and now I'm sweating a little bit. The materials and lesson plans won't be a problem, and it's only an hour a week, but I have no idea how to manage a classroom.

What advice/resources can I use to not get trampled by middle schoolers?

teaching,MathyKathy,2018/01/24,"Personalized Learning Hey fellow teachers! I've been tossing around ideas lately of how to turn my lessons into a more personalized learning experience, where each student gets to work on what they need.

I'd love to know how you make it work in your classroom. I teach math in middle school/high school, but I'll take ideas from anyone! 

Obviously the prep work is going to be increased to do this, I don't think there's a way around that. One of the other roadblocks I'm hitting is the timing of things--how do I set deadlines for things (assessments, for example) if kids are all working at their own pace? Once they all go off on their own path, how do I bring them back together?",6.159545454545455,6.5490520757575785,5.952575757575757,81.77386363636364,66.12121212121212,8.721212121212123,30.893939393939394,8.472884824447931,2.150921212121213,542,19,106,7,8,169,94,132,0.0,0.949,0.051,0.7347,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,2,5,5,8,1,0,0,5,0,9,1,0,4,3,21,22,5,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,6,4,0,0,7,0,0,4,1,0,0,1,1,0,12,1,20,19,7,20,0,0,0,1,13,11,0,1,3,67,18,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11470300240693827,0.0,0.0,0.292066919747744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12613929601318946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16046598271536136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08570593793402945,0.0,0.18645935898618932,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1733209235734591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37037020094949374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09015399627483987,0.0,0.18504816968233992,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14805562859216295,0.0,0.1095002842986528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12163614803628145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17470093258488906,0.11116009491852533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28647284607542345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3320414815857105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12334026750740215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10898318655695494,0.1051124262764306,0.0,0.0,0.09565506154124154,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17843217973058742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13021006405970806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4777023745712559,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,UNAMANZANA,2018/01/25,"How do you handle applying for new jobs without telling your principal and department chair? Hello everyone! Title is self-explanatory. Here are a few more details:

1. I live in Illinois, and most schools, here, use a program called Applitrack.

2. I have good relationships with my superiors and co-workers, but it's definitely time to look for something different. Most applications require references and reference letters, and so far, all of my reference letters are from student teaching (Spring of 2015). I covered a couple of maternity leaves at the school I student taught at the following year, so those same references would have experienced me in a professional capacity post-student teaching.

Is it fine if I list those references? Should I click the box that says, ""It's ok to contact my current employer?"" Unfortunately, I currently work at a private school and our contracts are year-by-year, so I'm worried that informing people that I'm looking for other options may affect whether or not my contract is renewed.

teaching,clynne92,2018/01/25,"Asking for help with resources: admin isn't helping. So, my district uses SRG grading, with scales and learning targets and the like. My teammate and I are struggling with finding/creating level 4 tasks. We've been told that we can't go up to the third grade scales because ""that's not a level 4"". But no one can point us to what a level four math task is. So we're stuck getting scolded because we aren't challenging our higher level kids, but no one will help us challenge them. Any ideas? 

Right now, we're working on adding and subtracting within 1000.",4.669742990654207,6.220841336448598,4.734661214953274,84.93974883177572,70.21495327102804,6.471495327102804,30.197429906542048,6.6274283507984215,1.6408327102803737,441,18,80,3,8,137,76,107,0.102,0.816,0.083,-0.0013,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.0,5,0,1,3,3,4,0,1,4,0,8,0,0,1,0,15,14,8,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,3,9,0,0,2,0,0,1,6,1,0,4,3,0,9,3,9,10,0,11,0,0,0,0,12,9,0,0,2,49,12,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14664465235223914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20159711958323528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2629079741711152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11266458071489716,0.0,0.1225549011360073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4336229241788828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24343472812459016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10535228992329564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2922505905218327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2038523614971257,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18415796589751451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2254369118309653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2060561524625466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5187840175557042,0.1862463372614511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1569906911788549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,acinomismonica,2018/01/25,"Would you give up your summers for a less stressful teaching job? Some background : I've been teaching for 5 years and currently have two older children (8 and 3) and a baby. I went on unpaid maternity leave for a year because two kids in daycare is over half my check. My friend works at a public charter school for adults and went on maternity leave for 6 weeks. I took it because the daycare there is free to use for employees.



Since being there I fell in love. Everything you hate about teaching, especially at the high school level is gone. These are adults who no parents to deal with. Zero discipline problems , no state testing, and just no anxiety or pressure from bosses (did I mention no discipline problems!) I just go in and teach in this beautiful school. My kids are watched for free in an awesome daycare and they are right there next to me for lunch. I haven't been offered anything yet, but talking to the other teachers it's similar to what I'd be getting, but the free daycare would be like a 5-8k raise. The con? I only get 4 weeks off in the summer and no fall break with my kids. I'd still get two weeks in Christmas, spring break, and a few other days. I just feel bad ""ruining"" my kids summer by having them in the summer camp /daycare. Plus it's one of the few perks of a lower paying job. Would you take less break for a no stress job?

teaching,apstritz,2018/01/25,"First time tutoring undergrad students... How do you efficiently tutor without teaching the entire course? So I just began tutoring at the university where I'm getting my MA, and it has so far been an eye-opening experience. I am working with student-athletes who, along with their aggressive training schedules, have had little time to adjust to the college lifestyle and are struggling to make sense of any of their classes. It is exceptionally challenging to work with the strict rules imposed to avoid cheating/unfair tutoring of athletes (which is reasonable). So far, they have no clue what is going on in many of their classes, quickly falling behind, and have missed all of the essential concepts of the subject. I can't, in good faith, sit idly by as they memorize vocab and read the textbook without understanding what they're doing. How do I help without having to teach the entire course? Am I taking on too much responsibility?

teaching,mitosis799,2018/01/25,"That one student that drives you crazy? Today I had a bad day. It should have been an easy day for me because we are reviewing for finals and I had a game set up and candy prizes for the winners. 

However in a couple of classes I have some real trouble makers (this is high school). In one of those classes I have one student who has never put pencil to paper in my class, not once. I can usually find her with her cell phone out, smirking at other students, or staring into space with a blank expression. 

The only time this student has completed any work for my class was during a time in ISS when she apparently decided to work, later in ISS she stopped doing any work also. 

Today I had quite the day, 5th period was already being monsters during a fun review game that helped them for their final. So I warned 6th period that even though we were playing a game, we were still following the rules such as not eating in class. Not 5 minutes later I look up and Missy DoNothing is licking something off of her hand dramatically, kind of like she was doing drugs or something in the back of my classroom. I was livid. I asked her what she thought she was doing, she stated that she was eating 'mexican candy'. At this point I had one of my most unprofessional moments as a teacher, I turned bright red I'm certain and I told her in no uncertain terms to go to the office immediately and while she was there she should talk to her counselor and ask to be switched to one of the other teachers that teaches my subject because I was done. 

Now I feel kind of bad because she was just eating in class, I think anyway, it might have been worse and actually been drugs, but I'm pretty sure it was just a very nasty way to eat candy. We do after all have a flu epidemic going on in the US right now and I feel like licking your most likely unwashed hand after sitting at a filthy desk at the end of a long school day is probably not the cleanest thing one could do at school. It makes me cringe just thinking about it, anyway maybe she will switch out of my class and I can move on in life?

teaching,FerrousBuchner,2018/01/26,"Teaching for college class in high school? Hi All.
I just started teaching science at a pretty affluent high school. Before this I was working towards earning my PhD in chemistry, but left partway through and earned my M.S. degree. 
My degree qualifies me to teach community college level chemistry classes, and I've heard rumors that I may be able to teach college level gen chem at my school (through some local community college) and give my students college credit, similar to an AP class (perhaps without needing the test?).

Does anyone have any experience with this? I think this type of class would be very popular at my school, and would be a lot of fun to teach.",8.179428571428572,8.736605800000001,7.517380952380954,71.70000000000002,61.83333333333334,9.19047619047619,41.30952380952381,8.841846274778883,3.9927023809523816,536,29,83,7,7,167,77,120,0.0,0.882,0.118,0.9396,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,0,0,3,1,3,0,0,4,0,8,0,0,0,1,16,13,5,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,4,5,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,11,3,17,5,3,13,0,0,0,0,4,12,0,3,1,53,15,27,0.16968711054802568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11539305399161805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11864917311701713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1443912330301287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14849433394183625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16598655451965336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1627793384947156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3585674975256746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1843655421082145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426191331943464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258208423737904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17263279504476156,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6869296601482991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12010541022065745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10872864877395333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1400096372739613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1635723192696359,0.0,0.1235342374426954,0.0,0.0,0.2410817095445458,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,SouthernWifey,2018/01/26,"Engagement Advice I teach first grade at a wonderful school and have a small class (19) because we are charter. This is my second year teaching and my kids last year absolutely spoiled me rotten. They were wonderful, actively engaged, and all excelling at their work. 

This year, my students are all just... average. I have 7 ESOL, 1 speech, 2 with SEVERE ADD/ADHD, 4 gifted, and 1 or 2 that have mild ADD. I struggle DAILY engaging them in anything new. The material and rigor of the school that I am in is much more difficult from the public schools. I have extremely high expectations for all of my children. Anything they deem “too difficult” I lose half of my class. 

We do yoga, I’ve tried taking away privileges, meeting with parents and explaining that I am prepping them for second grade and how fostering independence is huge... I’ve explained to my kiddos that they are responsible for their own education and that I cannot FORCE them learn anything. 

I would like to see more than 1 or 2 of my kids be on honor roll at the end of the year and I’m just really discouraged. I have explained this all to admin, and my team, and they have pretty much said I’m doing everything I can (my degree is SPED so I over-accommodate all the children) but I feel like I can do MORE.

teaching,Nessunolosa,2018/01/26,"Ways to feel safer in unsafe classrooms I need help. I teach in public school in a developing country, but the school system here is very developed. However, like many teachers I feel unsafe at times in the classroom.

Students do not listen to me because I'm the English teacher and they don't feel obligated to do so. My lessons are 35 minutes, twice a week  for each class. I teach grade 1-5.

Today there were two incidents that b made me feel unsafe. 

* A student threatened me with a fountain pen and swore at me. This is because I enforced the rule that they must not do other homework during my lesson (it's a paid extra service so their parents are losing money if they don't do the lesson). This student previously groped me inappropriately and is always rude in class.
* Very young students were completely out of control in grade 1. There are 45 of them and they fight a lot. I am supposed to have a native teaching assistant but they are often MIA. 

I am not a new teacher. This is my 6th year. But I feel so unsafe and constantly stressed by the students.

What ways can I feel safer or be safer in the classroom?",2.988968253968256,5.386489537037036,3.9908730158730172,84.77000000000002,77.24074074074075,5.966137566137568,27.415343915343925,7.07126945348624,1.4946788359788368,884,37,163,10,21,285,121,216,0.1,0.833,0.068,-0.8403,2,0,0,0,1,0,25.0,0,0,7,5,7,5,2,1,15,0,22,0,0,2,1,31,33,13,0,3,8,1,6,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,9,0,2,0,5,4,0,2,4,7,24,1,19,27,3,20,0,1,0,0,12,10,0,4,8,113,32,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13846456741865898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2028812232663362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1744753456866561,0.1798276457313239,0.1866404264282978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5048445094221993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11153959805529916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0812984144772898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18616769169948907,0.0,0.1414739067802614,0.0,0.15745902385253113,0.0,0.16871132608985304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.123389228074279,0.0,0.16071762886954352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18477609836179426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3368270268578397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1906194999343428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09703368937210112,0.0,0.15773507666158856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16255617857634466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27460762049058673,0.0,0.26417343119148257,0.13348224866502298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071611264177837
teaching,m150936,2018/01/27,"Looking for advice I’m currently serving as a Naval Officer and have 2.5 years left in my commitment.
I have a B.S. in English. I still don’t know what I want to teach. From what I’ve read if I decide to be an English teacher I may not have to go back to school (depending on the state) since that is what my undergraduate degree is in. I’m hesitant to jump into being an English teacher because I don’t want to deal with a bunch of homework, reading books and hundreds of essays. I know it sounds lazy but I’m just looking forward to time spent with my family when I’m out of the Navy. I took plenty of math courses in college hence the B.S. but am wondering if I would have to go back to school to be a math teacher?
I have heard of Troops to Teachers but don’t know if that’s the best way forward for me. I’m thinking I can knock out some online classes the next two years while I’m on active duty but ideally it would be working towards my masters and not a second bachelors degree. I don’t know what I should get my masters in either.
Sorry this is sort of a stream of consciousness but I am unsure where to start and also unsure where I want to end up so some counsel would be nice. Thank you friends!",4.315502988047811,4.661273187250995,5.430913844621514,84.0667691733068,70.11553784860557,8.027988047808766,30.030129482071715,7.8658589789855275,1.8766750996015944,954,36,198,11,16,317,130,251,0.04,0.836,0.124,0.9694,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,1,0,5,9,5,0,0,13,0,25,0,0,1,1,44,50,17,0,11,12,0,0,0,1,5,0,2,1,0,9,9,0,1,8,3,1,6,6,0,0,2,3,4,22,5,38,37,5,35,0,0,2,0,4,17,0,9,14,138,31,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14265180309887854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11674165627983192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22450210879577054,0.0,0.08898919877731529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1531989761499536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15050090770296576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12929661550349272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13761872392092106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11278523796396515,0.0,0.0762695068493847,0.0,0.1659297325265319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3209112928290208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1586097391942404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24517602457781595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15525338495725788,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2920427685033146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29548291127242976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12075771924250132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16341476236742086,0.10332672566186084,0.0,0.11658131752668345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13440050134282716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09353929388202374,0.0,0.0,0.0851232078810416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1621912394742724,0.0,0.0,0.14260308425704746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2583116843354119,0.11587362103551062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15831112112800033,0.10627654689857728,0.0,0.0,0.31110401627749434,0.0,0.0,0.1880150883647692

teaching,Gregarious2,2018/01/28,"Podcast: How to not Suck at Teaching: Lesson Objectives. I would love some thoughts/feedback Hi everyone,

I started a podcast last month called ""How to not Suck at Teaching"" The idea is to cover some pedagogical concepts as well as to have guests come on and talk about specific educational issues. Each episode is about 15-20 minutes. New episodes are released every Tuesday morning. My latest episode is about creating lesson objectives. I would love some feedback on how to improve my work, or if you're interested in being a guest let me know.

I have a transcript of the episode below.

When I first started teaching I quickly realized how inadequate my undergraduate and graduate teaching programs were. This is not to say I didn’t find anything of value there, but I didn’t effectively learn how to do basic things like creating an objective for my lessons. Instead, I was taught a very Marxist approach to learning where all students need to do is have discussions about oppression and that will lead them to success. I floundered in a sea of educational chaos, during my first-year teaching, needless to say. Though, at the time I felt I was the benevolent rebel fighting against the oppressive charter school I worked for. Yet, my second year I completely flipped the script combining some of my ideas on existentialism, democracy and the charter school I worked at’s philosophy of structure and direction. One of the most important things I learned was how to create an objective. A rigorous and specific objective is the anchor that holds down the lesson. Everything you do as a teacher should keep in mind, what is it you want your students to be able to do on their own by the end of your time with them. Each day this comes in the form of the learning objective. 

Main Points

Determine outcome 

Could be based on state standards, common core etc.

Trust yourself to know what students should learn (you’ll most likely be able to align this to a standard) 
o	What will an exemplar look like? What qualities will it have? Create a rubric or criteria for success
2)	Determine an action using Blooms Taxonomy or similar 
o	http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html (Use list for key words)
o	Most admins will want to see you above the understanding piece. Though I think when making coherent units, it’s often necessary to make the objectives in early lessons that of remembering or understanding, but you can always manipulate the way to objective is written to appease administrators. Example: If you want students to understand a concept like Imperialism by describing it, since that is a tough concept for some students and 45 minutes might only be enough time to just be able to describe it, you can say “students will be able to “demonstrate” their understanding of imperialism using an example from history” Technically that wouldn’t be in the “understand category it would be under the applying category.

Passive Verbs to Avoid
appreciate	enjoy	learn	realize
believe	know	like	understand

Active Verbs to Use			
add	compute	inspect	rate
alphabetize	construct	list	review
assemble	debate	locate	say
assess	define	match	select
build	design	measure	show
calculate	discuss	operate	solve
collect	draw	place	speak
color	explain	plan	write
compare			


3)	Be specific
o	Simply saying something like students will “create an algebraic equation” or they will “solve for x in an expression” is not specific enough. I usually make sure I do the following in every objective I write:
	Active verb (use blooms)
	How many
	How to accomplish? By Using… (whatever the scaffold or strategy you taught)
	Checklist for evaluation (Criteria for success, future episode): What show’s mastery? Accuracy? Quality? Quantity? Etc.
o	SWBAT solve two algebraic equations by using cross multiplication to isolate the variable 

Recap once:
1) Determine outcome 
2) Determine action Using Blooms
3) Be Specific

Example
1)	Determine Outcome: Using the cc standard: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.1
Cite strong and thorough textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text.
o	Using the story “The Lottery” by Shirley Jackson which is “spoiler alert” about a town that has a lottery every year, you think it’s a positive lottery but it turns out the winner of the lottery gets stoned to death.
In the text determine for yourself what an exemplar inference looks like: 
“Soon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times.”

This section of text from ""The Lottery"" indicates a few possibilities. One is that the people gathering for the lottery, the stoning, are so used to this tradition that it is treated with the same nonchalance that they treat other routines. This is why they engage in small talk about planting, taxes, and tractors.

2)	SWBAT Using Blooms and be 3) specific: Inferences fall under analysis, but I can even go higher in my phrasing so I will say:
o	SWBAT create two inferences about the town depicted in “The Lottery” by using accurate text evidence and reasoning
o	Criteria for Success: Next Time?

Recap
1) Determine outcome 
2) SWBAT Using Blooms
3) Be Specific
Questions that remain for future episodes
1) How to create a Criteria for success?
2) What if my admin wants something different? 
3) What if students don’t master?
4) How to differentiate objectives?
5) Language objectives?

Conclusion

Without the lesson objective, a classroom will most likely feel aimless. That doesn’t necessarily mean no learning will take place, but you can be so much more efficient and focused if you have a clear objective on what you want students to leave with knowing or being able to do.

teaching,disposable_teacher,2018/01/29,"Observations for undergraduate biology I've been teaching biology at the university level for a little while now. I was wondering if people here would be willing to do some observations of my teaching. Not sure if that is allowed here. I have recordings of my slide decks with audio. Unfortunately, I do not have footage of me walking around at the front of the classroom. I've already had observations done with institutional CTLs in the past, but I think it would be really beneficial for me if I were to open it up to a larger audience who know the ins and out of pedagogy.

I have an interest in the science of pedagogy (I've been to ASMCUE, for instance), but I would not consider myself an expert.

teaching,coldglassofkraken,2018/01/29,"K-2: need advice I’m not a teacher, but I have been hired to be a K-2 leader for an after school program. I’ll have assistance for a week or two, but I’m looking for ideas on activities.

Basically the kids start out by doing homework. When they’re done, they need to work on an educational activity or read a book. This whole part takes an hour.

Then it’s snack time (30 mins) and the snacks are supply by my employers. After that, the kids do another activity (doesn’t always have to be educational, but they’d prefer that it is most of the time).  I have a few ideas already, but am open to suggestions. This should cover an hour.

The rest of the day is simple; gym time for 30 minutes, and then computer time until their parents pick them up (about 30 mins).

The only concern I have is they want all the kids do the same activity. I don’t want anything too simple for the older kids and over the heads of the younger kids.

Any advice?

TL:DR - I was recently hired for a K-2 leader at an after school program, and need suggestions for educational activities for the kids.",2.299875874520424,4.606694853080568,4.099187542315509,83.56936808846764,79.14218009478672,7.052222974497856,22.843827578424737,8.11559375814309,1.3283268336718574,838,27,168,16,21,282,112,211,0.0,0.985,0.015,0.2263,2,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,0,5,1,3,0,0,0,24,0,22,3,1,1,1,26,32,14,0,7,7,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,6,6,6,2,0,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,1,3,1,11,0,28,25,7,27,0,0,1,0,14,7,0,3,20,113,17,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2899135854238617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16369762576927402,0.0,0.12343132656914554,0.0,0.0,0.10087674716325988,0.155548133872797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12207173770766075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09566746473246646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1518040153309693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15224033086525451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29217137173790725,0.0,0.0,0.3349171364366662,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12456880810692372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3299781970827599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11281976932829822,0.0,0.0,0.16471476684795372,0.1606384974731844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14838082007140854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14646852256266266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3002573692640005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1049962946699456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11153372786204437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345994566678807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14490728666361558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1749903493114809,0.0,0.11898994329964675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16561706829439302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10799377956855266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,crazylegos,2018/01/29,"What are reasonable rates for a private English tutor? I’ve been asked by a parent to tutor her elementary aged child in English. I will be helping the student with homework and some extra practice in writing and grammar. The parent wants to know my rate for each session. I’ve done a bit of research for private tutoring rates, but there is a huge range from $20-$120 an hour.

To be honest, I have never really privately tutored a student for money before. I taught English for one summer in Taiwan after I graduated from high school, but that was about 10 years ago. I have a full time marketing/PR  job at a corporation so this will be after work. My degree is in English from UCLA if that’s relevant. 

The family is question is an Asian family in a middle/upper middle class area in the San Gabriel Valley in California. They are my s/o’s aunt’s coworker’s acquaintance I believe.

Can anyone advise me on a reasonable rate for tutoring?

teaching,joyosects,2018/01/29,"Poor Student Survey Results The schools I have been at have generally had students complete teacher evaluations. When I started teaching (the first 5 years or so), most of mine were good, and students always gave me generally high marks. A few years ago, they started to get worse, and this year I would say they are bad (not awful, but bad). 

I still like students. I have always had a ""hard"" class, and I've never been known as as an easy grader. I've never been one to give students answers, and while I'm happy to guide, I make them work for them. I have always had the perspective of what is difficult for you is generally good for you. Have other teachers gotten comparatively better which makes me look comparatively worse? Am I just naturally less enthusiastic in my 30's than I was in my 20's? Has anyone experienced a similar occurrence during their career, or does anyone have any advice? I don't necessarily care if I'm loved, but I know that being actively disliked is a bad thing.",5.584607157548334,6.88800935294118,6.615721925133691,73.25172768408063,67.77005347593582,8.962402303578775,30.427396133278485,9.265573868473778,2.7148670505964634,787,30,140,15,13,263,121,187,0.132,0.7020000000000001,0.166,0.8752,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,0,2,5,3,4,11,0,0,8,1,23,1,0,3,2,24,37,14,0,2,7,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,6,4,0,0,3,0,1,0,4,4,0,2,10,4,23,7,14,25,3,16,0,0,1,1,11,4,0,4,13,96,29,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14035083524822267,0.12731684473241436,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3585280024966337,0.0,0.0,0.0976714195768902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20085495216731228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3597681321344366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1270265845659508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14643750023775245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1505903840963838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12568912853521896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12216922093461832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07503928276925746,0.13778029542160197,0.0,0.24093535805660124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528938226171868,0.12866175782247438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15175001997958054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0789337516433645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07016899387349035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12061067257763168,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12962915344394438,0.0,0.19174453940695307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22154829830084288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09732550621719277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11421811233133793,0.0,0.14535839189469038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20332013945949406,0.0,0.11470086556050632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09541952810127298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10456231046847173,0.0,0.2927367696055475,0.10202864033284756,0.0,0.0,0.27747361881896043

Hi all, So I'm running a public speaking class for kids aged 9-11. They are great speakers and very confident. I have 2 classes of about 3-5 students each. They are very keen and love to talk, but I am running out of ideas to use as warm up activities. The ultimate goal of the class will be for each of them to write a speech and deliver it at an even in front of their friends and parents later this year.

I want to keep making the class fun though and not repetitive, But I am running out of ideas for activities for the classes. 

If anyone knows of any fun public speaking games, or just speaking warm up games that would be good for kids, I would be really grateful!!

teaching,Squarepantss22,2018/01/30,"Missing Last Days of School for Vacation? This year my district (CT) has had a lot of snow days. Right now, we are at 6 snow days, so our last day of school is June 19.

I have booked a vacation to California from June 22nd to June 30th. I was not expecting there to be so many snow days when I booked it!

I have contacted the superintendent to ask about what the specifics for this town are in terms of making up snow days, but I was wondering if anyone else has ever had this issue?

Has anyone ever missed the last days of school because of a pre-planned vacation? How did administration react? Did you just change the plans?

Any and all feedback is appreciated!

teaching,trapqueen92,2018/01/31,"Coping with belligerent students? This is my second year teaching and most of my kids are really great. However, I have one student in my last two periods who has a 504 and absolutely hates Language Arts. She winds up running out of my class every single day (when she actually shows up) and does zero work when she is here but then melts down when her grades are low. She’s missed a ton of school due to spending time in an in-patient mental health facility and randomly going on vacation. She is very manipulative and pretends to have panic attacks to get out of class and once even faked a seizure. I could deal with all that if not for the fact that she often becomes belligerent and will raise her voice or even cuss teachers/admins out. I’ve done an okay job of staying calm, not escalating the situation by getting in a power struggle and letting her walk off and then calling the office to go make sure she’s ok. Admins/Guidance are sympathetic and are going to have her placed in a Special Ed class in high school, but she has zero consequences and my vice principal said to exempt her from any missing work at the end of the trimester and if she turns in one assignment then whatever she gets on that (even if it’s an A) will be her grade. The student is smart enough to realize I have to pass her no matter what and because there are no consequences she feels free to do and say whatever she wants. Although my admins don’t blame me at all and have been very relaxed about the situation, I’m having a really hard time handling it emotionally. I feel anxious all the time, get stomach aches, and dread going to work each day. Is this just part of the job? Will I learn to develop a thicker skin over time?

teaching,violetmoonlight,2018/01/31,"What is the best way to go about asking a former teacher for a recommendation? Hello, after much soul-searching, I am contemplating going back to school to get my teaching license. My local educator preparation program requires that I have a recommendation from a college faculty member and a current K-12 teacher. However, I graduated high school nine years ago and have not kept in contact with any teachers other than one who I am friends with on Facebook. There is one other teacher whose contact information I could get who I would feel comfortable asking, but I don’t want to step on any toes or seem like I am “using” them. What should I do? 

Thank you!

- Clearing the cache
- Clearing cookies, history, etc.

teaching,teacherdudeguyman,2018/02/01,"Group rotations for presentation advice needed for student teacher(s) Okay teacher friends. I am a student teacher that is teaching with another student teacher in a co taught American history/English class. Our cooperating teachers let us come up with a project that they wanted and it just had to meet certain expectations. The issue we are having is with rotating groups when they present. 

We will be in the library on presentation day. There are 5 groups of 4, and 5 groups of 3. They are researching different themes from the 50s/Cold War. The students must present their findings to their classmates in an on going presentation at the library. So they are all presenting at once but we need to make sure the students get to all the other groups to learn the content. And that is our dilemma. We can not think of a proper rotation so that everyone hears each other’s topic. Our best thought is to just let them go freely, figuring they will figure it out. 

Class is an honors class (highly self motivated kids, and class is roughly 90 minutes long)

teaching,joantheunicorn,2018/02/02,"Alternatives to Wilson Reading? (X-posted r/specialed Wondering if anyone here had their district switch from Wilson Reading to another highly structured reading program. Our district is looking at phasing-out Wilson Reading because students are burning out on it (high school level, usually 9th and 10th graders who also had it in middle school) or not quite having their needs met. We also have higher level intervention classes which use the program Reading Plus. We have a few kids that are struggling in that area as well. If anyone can recommend any other programs that could possibly work as a middle ground, I would appreciate it. 

One teacher in our district is piloting Rewards (Voyager Sopris Learning) soon, but I am not familiar with it. If anyone has worked with Rewards and Wilson and would like to make any observations comparing or contrasting the two, that would be appreciated as well! I see Rewards does get into some decoding, so that's good to see.

I am so stumped on this question!

Does anyone else have any other reasons? It would nice to see others' input.

So I’m in need of putting a teacher on a support plan which will be managed by a more experienced colleague. However I’ll have to write up some policy for the department on this as it’s our first instance.

So I would like to anonymously crowd source as part of the information I’ll use to create these policies.

teaching,theINFOsponge,2018/02/03,"Any computer software/website to help my sister with an intellectual disability? Hello, my little sister has an intellectual disability. She has trouble learning things and remembering them. To put into perspective, she is about to turn 20, and does not know more than basic multiplication, does not know how to use money, and reads at about the four grade level. 

I am looking for a software or website where there are games and things that would teach her things like math, reading, but more importantly, things that she can directly apply in life, like using money. 

It would be nice if I can track the amount of time she uses or her progress because I am at work/school for most of the day. I also need to learn to build some trust that she is using it instead of just saying she is.

teaching,sowega,2018/02/04,"G Suite vs. Microsoft 365 (x-post from /r/edtech) I’m a technology coordinator for a gargantuan high school (about 4,000 kids) in one of the top fifteen biggest districts in the country. I recently took the same position at a different, much smaller and brand new STEM school in the district. The new principal wants me to explore Microsoft 365. Here’s some background: 

The district uses D2L as its LMS but recently G Suite is becoming a huge favorite among teachers. The powers that be don’t really like G Suite. They claim their hesitation is for student data security reasons, but the feeling among staff is they actually don’t want to look dumb by spending a bunch of money on D2L when Google can do most (not all) of their services for free. Teachers are unrelenting, though, so the district made the shortsighted decision to allow individual schools to create their own G Suite domains a couple of years ago. Now, we’re slowly moving to a district domain. This is good because I don’t have to manage it anymore, but they have turned off Gmail, Sites, and Classroom. We’re all fighting for those services, but no one knows if/when they’ll be turned on. 

My new principal wants me to explore Microsoft 365 as a Google replacement. I love G Suite, but he feels that he doesn’t want to use it if the county is going to poopoo it. My main concerns with 365 is that it will cost money at our local school and that we will be the only school in a district of 200 schools who will use it.

So here are my questions:

- Have you used G Suite and 365? What are the similarities and differences/advantages and disadvantages?

- Do you think there is actual concern with student data security in G Suite, and is it more concerning that any that exists with 365?

- The new school is starting off primarily with Lenovo laptops for student use, though Lenovo Chromebooks are popular in my district. Is that a consideration one way or the other?

- What else haven’t I considered?",6.403745421245418,7.5285149423076945,6.66346153846154,74.3023717948718,65.78571428571428,9.693040293040294,34.12271062271062,9.827888789773867,3.4122402930402926,1565,69,274,33,24,504,187,364,0.045,0.83,0.125,0.9817,2,0,0,0,2,0,50.0,2,2,7,2,10,9,2,0,25,0,32,1,0,8,2,47,54,21,0,5,9,0,2,1,0,4,0,0,0,1,20,12,0,2,10,0,5,5,7,2,0,3,2,3,21,8,42,45,10,37,0,0,1,1,18,20,1,5,12,177,41,16,0.0,0.0,0.1700036986224102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07721326725817769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059234341214835264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08638468747892454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05309835851615745,0.09620055471818298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09637995130835618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09100611536760332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07276499423877975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0880857424018418,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04950374060694352,0.07305948491210422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09203114382659554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04787059304005852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04255507029394555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07314620555903747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07861560259645932,0.08242079346248878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09257875849704536,0.06403214798182602,0.0,0.0,0.3365059472804457,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1770736701426979,0.0662472264431357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08342244753225879,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09757745956291396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05580165035895645,0.08955837815706275,0.1720112253157468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6170838956636759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06165331971606335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0558133237531971,0.171160308311371,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09677678527408226,0.0,0.18949030800795086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37615347421121376,0.0,0.0,0.20550698455103736,0.06913984120370936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05609272083357846

teaching,thatoldguyfromup,2018/02/05,"Certification Exam Problems - may cause me to lose my job. Advice needed. So, long story short, I am a 22-year-old new teacher that graduated from a College of Ed last May, and am now teaching High School TV Productions. I was supposed to be teaching English, as this is what I am certified in, but they gave me TV productions because I took that very same class all four years of high school, and taught the previous teacher how to use all the equipment when he came in to teach the class during my senior year of high school. 

I am teaching at my old high school, everyone says I am doing a better job than the previous teacher, but I still have to pass a certification test per my agreement-to-earn. 

The problem is, the exam is ""Engineering and Technology Education 6-12."" Not just simply TV Productions. On the exam, the topics range from: agriscience, biomedicine, electric, engineering, manufacturing, woodworking, automotive mechanics, physics, and a little bit of math.

I took the test one time. not a SINGLE TV production question on there, because the exam encompasses all of the Career and Technical Education classes (CTE). 

In short, what the hell am I supposed to do? My mentor and my admins all say that it's bullshit that I have to do this. I've heard ""Oh, principals can work a lot of magic if they really want someone in a position."" Even my own administrators have told me, ""You're not going anywhere."" But this still doesn't reassure me. I am still freaking out.

I guess I'm just looking for support from teachers who have been in the game. I'm teaching in Florida, if that puts anything into perspective.

teaching,Anon6390183,2018/02/05,"What to do when a teacher wont accept your work but accepts everyone else's. So for the past 3-4 months I have had this teacher that will not accept any of the work I give him. For the first month or so I was just like ""it must be something to do with my work"" so I kept fixing it and sending it back to him. Everytime I did he came up with another part of the assignment that we weren't given. 
When me and a friend confronted him about this he told me to print the work out again and he would accept it then but when I went back to the computer he literally ran out of the class and to his car.
Now every day I argue with him and he has started saying that he never gave me those extra problems but me and about 5 others walked up to his desk and confronted him about it again because they all heard him say it and he couldn't do anything.
He still won't accept my work and just for a bit of classwork me and a friend copied each other word for word I gave mine up first and he sent it back and my friend went up 30 mins later with the exact same work and accepted it. 
We have talked to everyone we possibly can and when he gets confronted by his bosses in our class he says that we are all lying and they don't believe us.
Is there really anything we can do about this tips would be appreciated.
Also I got a few people's from class work and am now taking their best parts from their work and 'improving' mine with it. This has seriously made me want to leave the course I am at as I feel very helpless.",4.9229057132842655,4.424852123028393,5.646787592008412,85.94521118121278,68.77917981072555,9.063371889239397,26.443918682089034,8.515128840125781,1.4273064844023833,1181,28,268,16,18,386,157,317,0.105,0.7959999999999999,0.1,0.5083,0,0,1,0,0,0,14.0,7,1,4,11,23,18,4,0,14,0,28,0,0,2,5,61,47,31,0,6,7,0,1,1,3,6,0,4,0,0,21,31,0,1,7,0,0,8,7,7,0,2,17,5,43,11,38,21,10,39,0,1,0,0,47,8,0,1,24,198,64,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08128871397148736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06912484429599552,0.10658789896434938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16729702531599694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23448555069517046,0.0,0.06196432153250781,0.0,0.0,0.11452367816880332,0.10667441382814877,0.0,0.1109744431142824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11625944132332858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0655552323978275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08491474360644917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08564371441376169,0.19426005963030207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051396817313632215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17292527151651438,0.0,0.0,0.2356014273195499,0.0,0.053107436750467835,0.09751103761297192,0.0,0.0,0.08129803651433473,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10763167415072704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04966059464399687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09618279528396352,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16227061464512138,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07839801904400731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22015204569999755,0.09703552651427308,0.07047065715213366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11459403845295303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09726441932069613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06511898863756402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2425062295056787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07825441002255146,0.0,0.0,0.07194772556425,0.0,0.08117706803927625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07642744030731106,0.08170166143118711,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09713002981515104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12227129957201432,0.0,0.0,0.08387111738289196,0.05995524731721085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18845938800198928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5920137916842821,0.0,0.0,0.1444171469462074,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,joshrichardsonsson,2018/02/05,"Some teaching feedback to deal with shitty students - From a shitty student. I hope that even some of you read this and atleast keep in mind some of the things I’m saying and hopefully prevent any more students like me. I’m a junior in high school with a whopping 1.3 GPA and 3 months of night school and I’m pretty close to being fucked. 

This is not me deflecting the blame for my poor performance in school. I might’ve had a million personal problems but that’s not an excuse for a GPA that low. However , I was dealt a horrible hand with teachers in an area notorious for it’s horrible teaching - Had I actually had good teacher since early on it might’ve been different. Just wanna give a quick few pointers to dealing with those pesky shitty students.

1) If a kid is constantly putting his head down , Isn’t social , seems withdrawn and generally isn’t very aware in your class then chances are he’s either depressed or going through a rough time. Screaming at him or scorning him infront of your class makes you no different than any schoolyard douchebag bullying him - Actually It’s worse because you’re in a position of power.

2) Chances are you and other teachers of your subject are teaching the same exact state approved material. The only difference comes in the structure of what you’re teaching. Good structure is everything. If you constantly overwork your students and give too much busywork then expect to find them falling asleep and withdrawn from your class. 
This isn’t them personally trying to disrespect you or making you look dumb. It’s the byproduct of having 7 other classes and that are just as rigorous as yours.
Remember high school is the first time you’re confronted with actual big boy stress and a lot of students who haven’t experienced this before are pretty much screwed.

3) Vocabulary alone doesn’t help students remember anything. Writing down a word and It’s definition alone doesn’t help anything stick out in my mind. Vocabulary in context leads to actually understanding the meaning. No writing involved. 

4) Have empathy. A lot of teachers were ace students and since early on they pretty much figured everything out early on , So they expect everybody else to be the same. 
If a student is a dick and performing poorly then by all means fail them and don’t look back , However if you find a student genuinely struggling and being respectful. Give him the benefit of the doubt.


That’s pretty much everything. I’ve been browsing through here and seeing some of your common complaints with students. I don’t want to overstep my boundaries in telling you exactly what to do. In all honesty I don’t know much about teaching but if teachers offered me these four courtesies earlier on I would’ve been the great student I used to be.

There’s a tangible rift between students and teachers do to you on average being 15-30 years older than most of us. We’re so different culturally and in our values that a lot of time intent is lost. 

I hope I gave you some perspective on the student side of things.",5.729964221824687,7.7146550554561735,5.818461538461541,76.50153846153849,68.21288014311271,8.777817531305905,35.00357781753131,9.289312734170188,3.502392486583185,2452,123,407,50,43,774,265,559,0.184,0.696,0.119,-0.9913,6,2,0,0,0,0,45.0,2,17,5,9,11,22,4,3,33,0,37,6,4,5,4,90,64,35,0,13,15,0,2,1,0,0,0,2,0,4,24,28,0,2,10,1,2,5,13,13,0,3,10,8,45,9,70,49,21,55,0,4,3,3,52,30,4,22,20,278,69,34,0.0,0.0,0.2739612978229529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1453807505076282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09545625846027744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11551236209529166,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05396784508840563,0.0,0.04278405508007383,0.0,0.059722168634705225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06045806470442298,0.0,0.15168985628184706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14471507133978612,0.060450139478817076,0.0,0.0,0.2933130711621751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0586304663347717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.046356455281196376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18923294999878731,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12829542861625734,0.05969922818744889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0648847961734811,0.0,0.2019832139351287,0.039887688131690094,0.11773550497423148,0.0,0.0773790846021347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0720299413879429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09408689931926384,0.14830837097764962,0.0,0.2091282842215211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062383551487773636,0.0,0.0,0.038571777858602566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0342887901297092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11787525546892302,0.0,0.07661509391680457,0.1790060407552049,0.0,0.0,0.09369791281454684,0.0,0.0,0.1529038325418856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1489101456653501,0.1417334548193506,0.0,0.056020906411539374,0.0,0.25796983397483525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06586376106726076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.053378768463864586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1225654706160446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2856130439828702,0.0,0.0671574572371444,0.0,0.07055519563718808,0.0,0.0,0.07020387903845345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15901158825044598,0.0,0.0,0.0558138383714292,0.0,0.2841234065436452,0.0559282672833717,0.06389368426493401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11611532595868902,0.0,0.0,0.07154465269765398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0803965497962401,0.07337248163176817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06134468389815801,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09325543926821282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12277611433569074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04765093054491972,0.0,0.0,0.07306494154095773,0.08442377623479402,0.06061720704347801,0.0,0.057909881315402825,0.041396864197299016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07152439490831737,0.04985732931984213,0.0,0.0,0.045196765489553904
teaching,keexity,2018/02/06,"Help with an emotional child Hey guys- I've been having a lot of trouble with one of my kindergarteners over the last few weeks, and I thought I could find some guidance on here.

My student is 6, and generally pretty sensitive to her peers normally. On top of this, her father just walked out on the family, so she has been EXTRA emotional, as one would expect, and has not (to my knowledge) seen a professional therapist yet. 

In my classroom, she has been causing a lot of disruptions. If she even has the slightest thought that someone is making fun of her, she screams at the top of her voice and begins to call herself names/yell at herself. She is clearly having a hard time with the abandonment and is taking it out on herself. I look for every opportunity to use positive reinforcement with her and tell her how awesome she is any chance that I get, but she doesn't take it in.

Her behavior is becoming REALLY disruptive and stressful to the other children in the class. When she starts screaming/gets really upset, I allow her to go to the office to reset and come back when she is ready. She has been sent home a few times because she is just too out of sorts. 

Does anyone have any advice for dealing with this child? I want to support her and show her love because I know she needs it so badly right now, but I also can't have the rest of my class feeling uncomfortable/unsafe because of her outbursts.

Help!!

Edit: My ultimate goal is to keep her in the classroom at all times. She is only sent to the office/home if it is the absolute last option.

teaching,halogente,2018/02/06,"Becoming a teacher--but which kind? Life exigencies are pushing me to get licensed in our state and try to get a h.s. (or possibly 7-8 grade) teaching job. I have a Ph.D. in a biological science and taught college before and so thought that I'd take the biology specialized test.

However, I don't *have* to teach biology. I like so many fields, and have tutored in quite a few subjects: English, Spanish, religion, biology, math, math test prep, history. I'd love to teach psychology or philosophy, though I know those are not ""main course"" classes. I also see there is no subject test in some of these.

The overall goals of this are, in this order though they are all close:

1. Actually get a job for the 2018-19 year. (So fields in demand may be a good idea).
2. Basically like the work well enough.
3. Do right by the students (to the degree that they will cooperate; my district has some challenges)

teaching,maroonmallard,2018/02/06,"University switched everyone to TESOL I am currently a junior, and about to enter the teaching program. We used to have specialities, mine was language arts, however; this year every ed major got switched to a TESOL or Bilingual degree plan. This means about 15 of our prior credits dont count, and now we need 15 credits of TESOL. This in itself was really frustrating, but beyond this I just dont understand it. 
I have taken many multicultural ed courses, along with bilingual ed courses.  In all of them, we read loads of literature on the problem... but we really have yet to read how to solve the problem. If feel as if bilingual ed is a huge problem, but not big enough to affect everyone. How am I (a white, monolingual) educator supposed to fix this problem?  And how does having a tesol certification help? I am worried that I am not truly qualified to be in charge of a bilingual classroom, if assigned in the future.

teaching,Sharkgirl89,2018/02/06,"Crappy Administration, even worse students, my mental health is suffering. I’m literally at my wits end and feel very unsafe and unsupported, please help. [long, maybe epic] I’m not sure I can deal with it much longer. The inmates are running the asylum and they know it. 

Let me paint the picture:
7th period, last class of the day. I have some of my best and worst students in this class. 2 girls who are BFFs are the bane of my existence. They routinely disrupt, disrespect, and scoff at myself and their fellow students. Yelling across the class room, cussing at and threatening other students, that’s the short list.  I have had one of them removed before and spoken to them about their behavior. 

NONE of their behavior, even though it’s repeated time and time again, is a referable offense. I wrote a corrective behavior report like I’m supposed to had had them sign. They laughed and knew nothing was going to happen, and that even if I wrote a referral it might magically disappear. 

Oh yes you read that right. Referrals (things that help us CYA and implement discipline) magically disappear at our school. And all the students know it. Only referrals deemed important enough are processed. I have written about 5 referrals this year (so obviously not a crazy referral lady, there would have been so many more at any other school) and only received 1 that got processed and the others have disappeared. I didn’t get feedback, I didn’t get told if it was an unreferable offense, nothing. Poof, gone like magic. 

I’m far from the only teacher who this happens to, another story. My room neighbor had to have a girl removed from her classroom for being disrespectful and a multitude of other things. It stemmed from the girl sitting in a seat other than her assigned one and cheating/on her phone. The teacher asked over and over again for her to move, she refused. Now, this doesn’t seem like a big deal, except it’s February and this student has been this way all year she has multiple referrals to prove it. The teacher calls for her to be removed from the classroom and assistance shows up. The girl wouldn’t leave until school police came. 

But that’s not the end of it. The student manages to slip the police and leave campus. She returns to campus and makes it all the way back to our classrooms (the highest, 3rd floor, and furthest hallway from the entrance to school) and threatens the teachers life. THIS GIRL IS NOT SUSPENDED OR ANYTHING!!!!! The multiple referrals she should have had, never processed. She looks like a great student on paper. Administration and guidance said it would look bad to punish her or change her teacher since she’ll be moving to a new school in the future. ALL MY WHATS!?!!?

If that’s not something that deserves discipline I don’t know that does. I don’t feel save or secure at work, I’m miserable, I haven’t cried this much in years. I don’t know what to do and I’m at my wits end. 

SOS, please send help I’m drowning.

teaching,Rabbit929,2018/02/07,"Sensitive issues with a coworker? Has anyone ever had any experience with a smelly or unhygienic coworker?  I have another teacher in my room and she is incredibly young but has terrible person hygiene.  She showers at most every 4 days or so, her hair is always terribly greasy, and worst of all she has a body odor/smelly breath problem.  She comes in very close when speaking to you and her breath is absolutely horrendous.  You can even see the plaque/bacteria lining her gums on her teeth.


Who would I even bring this up to?  I mentioned it to my vice principal and she laughed and said ""Oh, Lordy!  I'm not addressing THAT!"" so it sounds like that was a failed attempt.  I'm legitimately having a hard time working with her and I fear that it may be a sign of depression or other underlying health issues.

teaching,EverReverie,2018/02/07,"Anyone with experience with TravelBud? I recently stumbled upon this website that offers placement in Asian countries. In my case, I applied to teach in Vietnam. I have a Sport Psych degree and do not hold a TESL certificate. 

However, they do recommend doing it through them. In the first month, they give you a 1 week cultural orientation and 3 weeks of TESL training. 

This sounds like a good opportunity, but I became wary once I saw that there were fees involved, amounting up to R25k (+-$2200), payable BEFORE you leave for Vietnam. 

Flights are not included to go there, and neither is accommodation, but they do give assistance in finding a place. 

I would like to know if anyone knows this company, whether it's a scam or not, if it's really as good a opportunity as it sounds and any other advice you might think is worthwhile. 

You may also provide me with any other relevant info, including other schools/companies offering similar opportunities or even your experience in such a situation. 

If it helps, I am from South Africa.

I'm currently an undergraduate Psychology major who is getting ready to start a tutoring job at my college in the Fall of this year. I would like to get a head start in learning how to teach; though more specifically, learning more about how humans learn. Jean Piaget is the only author I've heard of who is possibly worth looking into on this topic.

teaching,L0st_1n_Translat10n,2018/02/08,"I feel like I'm not good enough to be a teacher... I'm working on my Associates degree in early childhood education. This is my last semester and I'm not very happy... I've been doing great in school up to this point. I've learned a lot and I feel knowledge and successful in the classroom. However, I feel like a failure when I'm at work. I am currently working at a preschool in the nursery 2 room. There are 8 one year olds in my care. Because my center is under staffed I don't have any help most days and I've been working 8am-6pm Monday-Friday. I don't feel like a real teacher in this room. I know any level of teaching should be seen as important but I feel like all I do is wipe noses and change diapers all day. I'm feeling burnt out. I brought my concerns up during group discussion with my internship class and my professor wasn't very understanding... She basically told me that if I can't handle being in charge of 8 babies how can I expect to control a classroom of older children. She told me that there are other girls in my program who have been successful and they're under more pressure than I am because they have husbands and children to look after etc... I feel like she's right. Any age group can be challenging to work with and if I'm not having the experience I'd like to have it's probably my fault. I honestly am trying my best. I'm not sure what else to do. My center doesn't have a lot of money and my room is lacking a lot of resources I could use to better the classroom experience... I don't think I'm going to participate in group discussion anymore and if I have to say something I'll just say I'm happy and things are going well. I hate being the only person in the room who always has a bad report. Anywho, does anyone have any advice on what I could do to make things easier for myself? Right now I've been reading to the children, working on teaching colors, numbers, and letters, we color, and I bought a bubble machine for them to play with. I also bought a bunch of baby books for them to look at and they've been enjoying that so far. I want to do well. I hate feeling like I've wasted two years of my life on a degree just for me to be a failure...",3.6703466035634733,4.6670582806236105,5.124949192650334,83.31043047048999,71.98440979955456,7.6614977728285085,28.06243040089087,7.972316293177498,1.754922550111358,1724,63,347,23,32,580,203,449,0.07400000000000001,0.762,0.16399999999999998,0.9888,2,0,1,0,0,0,48.0,1,0,3,12,11,28,2,1,20,0,46,2,1,4,3,61,82,24,0,9,10,1,8,7,0,1,1,2,4,5,14,20,0,1,13,3,3,3,10,5,2,2,12,16,48,23,55,61,12,50,0,0,5,0,26,33,0,7,21,231,62,22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07938069170994752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06496260983420303,0.06759299718507608,0.0,0.0,0.22096697415712,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08056206338353675,0.056800534917413624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06782679783253856,0.09903869422191468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08524982111589363,0.07184466077856856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08282323393793695,0.0,0.08593454860224531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09111057112571676,0.12971709723568126,0.0,0.0,0.10477811191217327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07108821223543471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678603841612259,0.0,0.0,0.08393619092692013,0.09059711740322426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1589244128404723,0.0,0.0,0.32859384549116466,0.3482004932794301,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923340375450623,0.06813502515354318,0.0,0.08956050898798139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17294969960193385,0.0,0.16040304348288692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05444927809278943,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04464395095070037,0.06621635786197512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05737780821375967,0.2778069886290534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13643180106312394,0.0,0.0,0.2071861175974316,0.0,0.0,0.05422416668490036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08524116785116936,0.0,0.055046099233238416,0.061781936260375925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07093018733140713,0.0,0.0,0.07679216182156856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08758373446905421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08125574464913106,0.09246180507952814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1387463771728957,0.0,0.12920069548044827,0.0,0.08221290364278237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06253771843264579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07656185898320123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10793620329967712,0.05205131438309512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15524468088594393,0.0,0.055152391829099326,0.0,0.07935358139462136,0.08456721072925115,0.0,0.07015988809066333,0.0,0.13405272168076252,0.0479137773092002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14607781499308062,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3548348757781696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1046237582847603

teaching,khloewithakay,2018/02/09,"Substitute advise - please, please help :) Hi there!

I recently graduated, got certified and became a substitute. I went to my first assignment and it was for two days -- it turns out they need me for much longer and I will be doing this assignment for 2 more months. 

This class in particular has not had a teacher or substitute since November. They have primarily been getting split up and placed with other classes everyday and been handed a packet of worksheets everyday. There is a massive teaching shortage.

Due to this - their behavior is off the walls. Understandable and I can level with it completely. Another issue is - I have no idea whatsoever to plan for them. No idea where they are in terms of curriculum. No idea of the levels of the different students in the classroom. I've been giving them busy work the past two days I subbed for them. I think that's also adding to the terrible behavior issues.

I will go back next week to substitute for the next few months. Here are my questions - am I out of line to e-mail the principal and ask politely for a direction of how to plan? Should I wait until I'm there and try to collaborate with neighboring teachers? I'm a brand new teacher and walking into this was a shock to say the least. I do not want to come across as rude to the principal - but I really need to know more about these students.

Please help with any suggestions on how to diplomatically handle this. I should add that it's an inner city school and the parents are not as involved as they should be from what I hear.

Thanks much :)",3.325125570776258,5.987681900684932,4.208739726027396,82.22415981735159,77.59589041095892,8.276894977168949,25.82922374429224,9.029198982220553,2.4073105936073063,1233,47,228,32,30,396,163,292,0.046,0.871,0.083,0.9273,2,0,0,0,0,0,34.0,0,0,8,4,10,4,1,0,19,0,26,1,1,2,0,40,45,19,0,6,5,1,1,0,1,5,0,2,1,0,14,19,0,1,7,0,0,4,6,3,0,3,8,3,25,1,46,30,7,37,0,0,0,0,21,16,0,2,17,166,39,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09427799005059492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801704328238316,0.12361977926726052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11021287223078832,0.0,0.0,0.09065147888878188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1015533039577868,0.12360725711178945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15206085188983667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12317178699050045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10027866250442087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061593573682681216,0.11309250921503715,0.06700059846134286,0.0,0.09428880226005018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13287257059918398,0.0,0.15804071022994345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3992563084650832,0.0,0.2460967159639268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06479022278032548,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1882001405309814,0.0,0.17332800240739216,0.17483047796097986,0.0,0.11386058698374694,0.2507584276042209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.130904837061265,0.0,0.11254101530595892,0.0,0.0,0.12317178699050045,0.3882292185104674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1320657410308044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07552447397593798,0.0,0.11640388076661246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09375225159613602,0.0,0.11931274515365756,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09752127403424453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1085388843380925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07554027327495275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08004075977552093,0.1282323707612524,0.2303262192296424,0.1227294696454942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06953560874435294,0.0,0.09456565089848787,0.0,0.0,0.10928683355247117,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08582659823755309,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Hobbes579,2018/02/09,"It's the thought that counts On Wednesday  one of my second graders comes in and tells me he's got a present for  me. He says he brought me something that will help me feel better when I feel sad about Genevieve (my daughter) passing away (last year). He then digs in his pocket, pulls out a locket, and shows me how it opens up so I  can put a picture of her in it. Now, of course my heart is  melting and my teaches-sense knows he snatched it from mom's jewelry box but I didn't want to hurt his feelings so I let him put it on me. We were closed yesterday for the Super Bowl parade so I didn't see his mom until today and not surprisingly she had been looking for it but her heart also melted when I told her the story. There's no other profession is the world that gives you the kind of payout you get from teaching. ❤

teaching,_iWantToTeach_,2018/02/09,"Is teaching possible with a criminal background? I graduated with an engineering degree but, after 15 months in the field, have quit my job and don't want to return to engineering. I have considered teaching for a long time but have avoided it because of my criminal history. I picked up three felonies 18 years ago when I was 18-19 years old, including one for contributing to the delinquency of a minor (for smoking pot and drinking with my cousin when I was 18 and he 16). For full disclosure the others were possession of a controlled substance and criminal impersonation. This was all 1999-2000, so a long time ago. I am considering going for either a second bachelors in education or perhaps a masters, but am wondering if I would just wind up spending a lot of time and money and being unemployable because of my past regardless. I'd like to believe that anything is possible, that if this is my dream I can pursue and achieve it, but am also vividly aware that this country (USA) holds a grudge forever once someone screws up, even if those mistakes were made when the person was effectively still a child and are not even remotely indicative of the person's moral character today. I have considered working specifically with troubled youth, but would love to be able to work with all kids if possible, perhaps even a GT program (I was a GT student, as is my younger son). Looking for advice or personal stories of overcoming one's criminal record in the education field.

teaching,thehandwowpack,2018/02/09,"Losing my M. Ed scholarship So, due to the time restraints that student teaching will call for next year, I’ve been told that I will no longer be given a scholarship/stipend for the remaining 2 semesters and 16 credits of my M. Ed program and assistantship. 

I don’t want to pay the money out of pocket to finish the program, I did the program because of the scholarship. 

I’m looking for advice about what I should  do next. 

I think it might look bad that I don’t continue with school, however, the aforementioned circumstances probably warrant it.

Can I get a full-time teaching job? I have 2 years of experience teaching high school abroad and 1 year experience as an adjunct at a local college? I don’t have an education degree. GPA for year one of program is 3.6 if that matters. (Located in PA).

teaching,iknowthingsandstuff4,2018/02/09,"What’s your opinion on education? High school student here and I would like some perspective from the other side of things:
    -Why’d you become a teacher?
    -Do you think compulsory attendance is beneficial? Do you agree with the “No Child Left Behind” legislation?
    -Did education prepare you for life? And are you preparing your students for real life?
    -Do you attend summer teaching workshops? Do they tell you what to teach and how to teach? How much flexibility do you have in meeting the needs of your students? 
    -What’s your opinion on mandated state curriculums? Reading lists?
    -How qualified do you think your colleagues are to be teaching? 
    -Do schools teach kids conformity? To what extent? 
    -How many of your students are “above their level” and do you think you’re stimulating their intellect? 
    -How much do you hate your job? How much do you think your colleagues hate their jobs?
     

TL:DR I want your opinions on the education system and it’s impact on society, thanks in advance! :) ",3.2234242181234976,6.2853057209302365,3.325429029671213,81.78476744186048,93.53488372093024,6.325902165196473,26.279871692060947,7.503015589744147,2.2349247794707288,792,35,128,17,29,242,98,172,0.051,0.8170000000000001,0.132,0.9194,2,0,0,0,0,0,32.0,0,21,4,1,7,4,2,0,5,0,18,2,0,7,0,25,27,11,0,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,2,7,6,0,0,4,1,0,3,1,2,0,0,1,0,27,2,18,24,5,16,0,0,0,0,29,10,0,4,2,92,34,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18433213850618813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3295659044153913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1763430325368019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33125254349862737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.181341471354782,0.0,0.23577818533546746,0.08154076797731281,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1692142606259604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3680805003218061,0.12375705580476065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16694897049814386,0.1899730687975714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33783112034952945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14588128124262054,0.1536625984516698,0.0,0.0,0.11088347105900376,0.4277808731853587,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098444187903136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11856367362799687,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,millese3,2018/02/09,First-year teacher looking for some advice on classroom management. This is my first year teaching 6th grade math at a private school. I wanted to create a pretty open environment where kids don't have to sit quietly while I talk at them. This was working great but I think I allowed a little too much to slide and now the room is getting a little too loud. Any tips on how I can reestablish a productive but not militaristic classroom. ,5.564430894308941,7.202903573170737,5.569268292682928,79.47552845528456,68.14634146341464,7.90569105691057,31.959349593495933,8.344100000000001,2.5299447154471535,351,15,61,5,6,110,62,82,0.0,0.915,0.085,0.6369,1,0,0,0,0,0,6.0,0,0,1,2,5,1,0,0,6,0,6,0,0,2,0,10,10,5,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,3,7,1,8,9,2,15,0,0,1,0,3,9,0,1,4,42,9,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23900681643852104,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16632701193988214,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4160898153647034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1277862012776109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2696571631051755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4902792807093325,0.0,0.0,0.20539081816154434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17979900887700112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24883210877416406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2475343052139963,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19658913310797144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1567209692200903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14426328533467692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17806167594461916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3150110039711371
teaching,h1bbleton,2018/02/09,"SDC substitute teachet I'm subbing in an elementary sdc classroom for the next two weeks and this is my first time in an sdc class. Ive been there for four days and was wondering if what I'm experiencing is normal:

There's a violent student who regularly hits teachers/students as a way to get attention, there are no lesson plans for the day (we struggle through maybe 30 minutes of learning a day), students regularly throw things (paint,blocks,etc) and we spend the majority of the day out on the playground. 

Is this normal for an sdc classroom? Im going a little crazy....

teaching,Glamrat,2018/02/10,"I now present my very strange schedule 12yrs teaching Middle School and never had a schedule like the one I was assigned this year.

P1: Advanced American History (7th grade)
P2: Plan
P3: Plan (PLC)
P4: Plan (Master Teacher duties)
Lunch
P5: American History (7th grade)
P6: Advanced World History (6th grade)
P7: Advanced World History (6th grade)

So after 1st period, it's almost 4hrs without teaching students. It's February and I'm still not sure how I feel about it. We only PLC a few times a week, and Master teacher duties are not every day, so I get a whole lot of plan time lol

Anyone with a similar schedule?",2.2428947368421035,5.114977850877196,3.5213684210526317,83.35257894736844,86.28070175438597,6.197894736842105,27.77543859649123,7.554174236665415,2.2166849122807024,481,23,81,9,15,156,77,114,0.056,0.8640000000000001,0.08,0.3889,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,1,0,0,9,6,2,0,0,6,1,3,1,0,1,2,16,6,6,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5,1,2,1,0,0,3,4,0,0,1,2,1,6,2,5,4,3,20,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,2,15,39,10,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2718811452605669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18984826943922964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17510348494568193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2287614933089519,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13728517919237535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14185438616258306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13264758385521172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23083072448111935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20940763758010195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.183984300394442,0.20649794405441915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2747857481421598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21683070887597167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2558978793799173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31664293899266305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22402673902380127,0.0,0.0,0.2177914278749181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3031346749486245,0.0,0.26172893519346113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17484553166153916

teaching,roadkill6,2018/02/10,"Funny student complaint. This happened over a year ago, but someone reminded me about it today and I thought I'd brighten everyone's weekend a bit with this story.

I've been teaching English at the high school level for about five years now and, early in the fall last year, I had a student complain about me to admin for the first time. The principal told me that the student had complained that all we ever did in my class was read and write and read and write and talk about reading and writing and then read and write some more and she really didn't like it. Apparently she demanded to know why we couldn't watch movies in class instead of reading books and why I had to always make corrections to things that she had written. She said that her teacher at her last school had told her that she was a wonderful writer and that he let her write movie reports instead of writing about novels and short stories.

The principal said she was biting her tongue and stepping on her own foot under her desk the whole time to try to keep from laughing, but after the student had finished her rant she very calmly explained that I taught an English class, that English classes tend to consist largely of reading and writing, and that if we ever stopped reading and writing and started watching movies in class that the student should come tell her right away.",12.89331583552056,8.38325926771654,10.608005249343837,69.27527121609802,56.71653543307087,12.706211723534558,47.513560804899384,8.841846274778883,4.5725350831146105,1090,49,191,9,9,327,134,254,0.07200000000000001,0.858,0.069,0.3087,1,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,3,0,0,1,10,5,0,0,14,0,15,1,1,1,4,48,31,22,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,15,23,0,2,4,10,0,3,2,2,0,2,19,4,27,3,30,9,6,37,0,0,2,0,37,14,0,3,21,135,42,24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09078991354438262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08522236110579715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09622777038643264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11181705342804173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08822650277801321,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18529106493648775,0.0,0.0978675218232318,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08711913203433848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09057042912125417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10821326292888242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09103636720008572,0.0,0.0,0.05628782666187375,0.1669733432702369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10473226958546623,0.0,0.05003765920102609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06836672002024807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7171400426901527,0.0,0.0656134261846944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0874668556653406,0.1948513858807676,0.0,0.0,0.20731075861652276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08678086314654401,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07249401256430757,0.0,0.0,0.08562842588821089,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08232200842857906,0.08952034688535496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06804386901802291,0.0,0.0,0.08131072310297066,0.11944485537724064,0.0,0.0970830004593148,0.1957350436464636,0.0,0.06953704152869973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08450793669506967,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18483779299093706,0.1143492336328532,0.0,0.0,0.11107105475964027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19786702942856285
teaching,Lety1984,2018/02/10,"Lesson Demo Nightmare Hello my fellow colleagues, 

I took the semester off from student teaching to help my parents and study for one more test that I could not pass last semester. I have completed all my MAT classes but I still need to finish my clinical experience. I am currently searching for teaching jobs but I am not sure if this is the right idea.
        I BOMBED my teaching demo yesterday.....I was too ambitious, nervous and did not think things through. I made a lesson that was too difficult, long, and I was not given enough time to fully prepare. I was placed in a room with 25 students and they were all clueless. I know it was my fault and could have handled it differently.  However, I was not given a standard and was just given a theme?????? I know I should have done the most simplistic demo in the history of demos...something a caveman could do. However, I fell short and did not successfully implement my demo. The principle stated that my objective was off and that the kids were confused. She said I did not time myself accordingly and was not sure why I did not know what I was doing.

......I understood my faults and didn't get defensive. However, its challenging when your blindsided and have no clue of the situation. I learned my lesson and hope to learn along the way.
I have been trained to prepare units and lesson plans. But preparing theoretical lessons isn't the same as being in the classroom. It has come to my attention that every charter school in my city has different guidelines and expectations. Most charter schools want different guidelines and expect extremely high expectations. I feel my education was theory based rather than clinical. I know I still have to finish my clinical assignment but I am scared my next assignment is not going to teach me the fundamental 21 century skills. I feel charter schools and public district schools have different outcomes and expectations. 

I am currently BUMMED! all my friends and old master teacher say I am truly meant for this profession. I am caring, speak two languages, and I love working with inner city youth. However, being a mentor and an aid is much different than being a teacher. Lets just say I'm getting sad, depressed, and feel discouraged. My first attempt to apply for a teaching position has made me realize I might not be cut out for this career. 



Any Thoughts or Advise is much appreciated.

teaching,MichaelsVintage,2018/02/12,"Most rewarding/satisfying teaching moments? In my short tenure (hah) as a sub and teacher, I had a great time teaching a variety of ages in multiple different schools. I was lucky enough to have a number of really great experiences in the classroom, and I thought it would be fun to hear some others!

Here's one of my favorites:

I was called to sub for a sixth grade inclusion class with a classroom teacher, co-teacher, and 3-on-1. All three were absent, and I was the only sub who answered the phone that morning. 

The teacher across the hall basically made the sign of the cross and wished me luck; she handed me a Nat Geo for Kids and a packet. She said my block for the day was to hand out the magazine, ask everyone to read silently, then pass out the packets and have them finished quietly until the bell. The packet was not going to be graded; it was just busy work.

I thought that sounded miserable, so I immediately made the decision to ditch the packet altogether and mix up the lesson. Our lesson was about sharks and I looove science and nature, so ad-libbing wouldn't be a problem. Instead of silent reading, we had a class discussion and made the classroom an open forum-type sharing of questions and facts about sharks. It was a blast! We talked about shark gills, shark skin, how their teeth grow in, Megalodon....

This was what made this particular lesson really special for me: Later in the day during my prep/lunch period, I had four children from various classes walk into the room from their library/study class. They each brought me a shark-themed project they decided to do on their own just because the lesson was fun for them! I got a picture with labels, a list of shark facts, a scale photo of Megalodon and a VW Bug, and a basic shark anatomy picture. 

It was a really special moment, and I'm so happy I made that day better for those kids.

I know there are a ton of other great stories out there, so let's hear them!

TL;DR I had a great time teaching about sharks and the students did work on their own time for me! Let's hear some other cool teaching moments!",6.404536104114193,6.833401488664991,6.3171693954659975,79.23412520990766,65.59949622166246,8.934047019311505,32.662573467674214,8.72156446121922,2.598701175482787,1649,64,304,23,24,520,202,397,0.015,0.838,0.147,0.9943,1,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,3,0,9,7,15,16,0,1,41,2,28,4,4,6,3,60,46,24,0,4,3,0,3,0,0,2,0,6,1,3,15,26,0,1,11,2,0,6,2,2,0,3,27,10,36,14,47,12,10,38,0,1,0,0,29,17,0,6,15,209,51,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09658084199300096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06297677656459938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09136924077519157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10549099283166864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19987908144168856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10793689209382476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10674677777644892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0987170686952905,0.0,0.10105693857078278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05871341597813628,0.0,0.08262639135034983,0.4555982655352789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10997534523567552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3493134101261194,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05677643765543655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21128281290204115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4887717849681443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07000548461183866,0.07857185973958601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09885365403430528,0.0,0.0,0.11573076909270084,0.0,0.20667578124131444,0.0,0.1985489663784549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09827140448139073,0.0,0.0,0.10455516814139897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08303661122488169,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16403309471180064,0.18072255903554152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11880132500758855,0.0,0.0,0.15042172398556314,0.0,0.0,0.07338841264127152,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Willisboy,2018/02/12,"What kind of assessment does homework classify as? I'm working on my EdTPA and I have to submit an assessment demonstrating my feedback and student understanding and I was wondering if homework would qualify as an assessment.

It's not really considered formative, since it takes a day for feedback.
It's not summative either, since homework typically only covers a small section.

So does it qualify as an assessment at all?",6.172915851272018,9.311488287671235,7.551115459882585,59.499315068493146,70.23287671232876,12.390606653620353,40.56555772994129,11.491704259439757,6.737698238747552,347,22,45,15,7,118,49,73,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,5,0,3,0,0,0,1,11,7,8,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,5,3,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,4,1,8,5,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,1,35,9,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18502449438214025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5021300836730744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29875853370468913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21819770007131764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18379323063372907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4746474637077641,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21571044724494126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2986693522327101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31112699292225193,0.2088640533849821,0.0,0.0,0.20380302697789532,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,ThatGeospatialGuy,2018/02/12,"Zoology teachers of Reddit, What are some activities you do in your class that the students like or respond well to? I'm a new teacher in my first year and my background isn't specifically catered towards zoology, but more of a biology and biogeography role. I teach zoology to juniors and seniors in high school and I'm using some activities my predecessor left behind for me. I didn't have a whole lot of time to prepare before I was hired so I am using her stuff. Each week so far the students have been broken up into small groups and are given coloring packets to color specific parts of the organism as they read through the packet. The packets also have questions quizzing them on what they just read. The students hate this. 

What are some things you have done, or you know that other teachers have done that make for a good activity/filler day. I teach in 1.5 hour blocks. I would like this day to be a day where I can wander around the classroom and help groups as needed, and have some free time for myself to play catch up. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",6.2385790071996965,7.098298541871928,6.5433497536945815,75.96272451686245,66.04433497536947,9.004774535809018,32.36415308829102,9.057496981413335,2.7297839333080716,856,34,156,14,13,276,123,203,0.054000000000000006,0.821,0.125,0.9341,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,4,3,1,7,8,1,0,12,0,21,0,0,3,0,27,30,15,0,2,4,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,11,10,0,1,2,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,6,2,20,8,27,22,9,27,0,0,2,0,14,15,0,8,13,117,31,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15467371706572464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12658000474550438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10763884297749417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14090670457810828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13468839520085624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30624109630717844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32395986248681274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1346366587670197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1327614735504316,0.0,0.1745091473640231,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15627310892432114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10609471966974167,0.16723619502176731,0.0,0.0,0.15587828359551653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08698898547364751,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1719765007596401,0.0,0.0,0.154659558469742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345677655481017,0.0,0.0,0.10565608884577092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11736590225397993,0.0,0.152872092765173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1714066174008651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17731479126174146,0.0,0.3166545361874064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16019229768946294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1811978078001277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10515714470796607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.184593852801046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27341386037678644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12696622544740782,0.0,0.14231671543237268,0.0,0.0,0.17671891798495434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11244072056666499,0.0,0.0,0.10192998598714574

teaching,GradSpeakThrowaway,2018/02/13,"Student Teacher Chosen to Speak at Graduation Hello everyone, hope you're doing well! I have a bit of a problem and I'd like some help/outside opinions/thoughts on something I've been reflecting on for the past couple days.

I'm student teaching an AP Lit class at a public option school (for the arts), which means it's on the smaller side and every senior has to take this class in order to graduate, so I've had a chance to work closely with all the seniors. 

Last week, the seniors had a meeting where they got to vote in a student speaker and a teacher speaker to speak at graduation this year. I was told by the students that I was relatively unanimously chosen to be their speaker, and that's super flattering! However, it's come with a few problems. For one, I have no idea how I'm supposed to live up to the expectations of my students. It's nice that they believe in me, or like me, or whatever, but I've never needed to do something so formal and anticipated before. I'm not really one for tradition, so it's pretty intimidating on deciding what to do.

On top of that, I've heard murmurs around the school that some staff members and administrators are upset that the students chose me instead of a full time teacher at the school. I understand and agree with the frustration that I, essentially the flavor of the month, take a huge opportunity from somebody who deserves it more. I have no doubt that there'd be hard feelings going around regardless of who was chosen, but as a result I'm feeling extra pressure to impress my peers so I can validate the decision our students made. 

Lastly, I don't even know if I have what it takes to pass edTPA and earn my license. If I can't pass that, then what business do I have speaking at that point? I'm not even a teacher, just a dude who failed a grad program. It's validating that my students believe in me, but I just can't make sense of what I did to deserve this treatment. This whole year it feels like I've been Alice wandering around wonderland. I haven't had a single disciplinary issue, students are receptive to being challenged, and I have an incredible relationship with my CT. Out of all the people in my program it feels like I deserve this bounty the least and I can't help but feel guilty. There are people who are studying to become high school teachers but get placed at a difficult middle school, or people are having issues with loans and that's getting thrown into the mix with all the other shit we have to do.  Don't get me wrong, I'm super happy with teaching and where I'm at, but it feels like the people who work harder than I do should get this and I want to improve myself to make good on the station I'm currently at, but I don't feel like I'm good enough yet and I don't really have faith that I'll reach that point soon.

So I guess what I'm asking is, how do you deal with handling your public perception as a teacher? What do you even say during a graduation speech as a teacher? If your students are playing you as a 'favorite' over other teachers how are you supposed to react?

To cap it all off, the public option school attracts quite a few teachers with a lot of professional experience in their artform, so I'm basically this dinky 22 year old child soaking up attention because I'm new, but I don't really have anything to offer them that the other teachers can.

Tl:Dr: Chosen to speak at graduation by senior class, but having trouble designing something that will appease the expectations of students, teachers, and administrators. Also struggling with my own views of self-worth vs. the feedback I get from other people. Looking for thoughts, opinions, feedback, advice, anything.

Thanks for your time! Hope you have a good day.

teaching,bingewarmer,2018/02/14,"Teaching Alternative High School Students This is my first year to teach in an alternative environment. I feel that I was thrown into the fire, because I had little training and my supervisors have been really hands-off. 

I know it comes with the territory of teaching alternative, but I am having a difficult time dealing with the students. I really enjoy them one-on-one or in a small environment, but if the class exceeds five students it gets hard to handle. 

It is really like something out of a movie. These kids have rough lives and I have a lot of empathy for them. However, it is difficult to make it through the day when work is not getting done along with hearing stuff I really do not need to hear.

I keep telling myself its going to be okay, eventually they will take school seriously. But it is February, and there has been little to no improvement. I can feel the burnout coming.

Any help or advice would be appreciated.",6.034055876685933,7.433657179190752,6.811690751445088,71.90381743737959,66.80346820809248,10.390944123314066,32.33574181117534,10.504223727775694,3.6204377649325625,744,31,131,20,12,246,111,173,0.079,0.797,0.124,0.9032,1,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,3,3,2,6,0,0,11,1,22,0,0,1,0,27,36,10,0,3,8,0,5,1,0,2,0,2,0,1,11,11,0,1,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,2,5,7,16,3,19,27,1,16,0,0,0,0,9,8,0,4,6,96,27,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15099133569986464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10507624037672636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09419157483017633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2662038609961734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09965009581635076,0.15929930491212627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1581236078048189,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1562559564697282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13143130796268976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1614565601302113,0.0,0.0878150552683035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13841606736967335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34830172860444136,0.0,0.10356887865331364,0.16325473353026002,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13734100115417694,0.0,0.0,0.08491800259937476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07548875709172594,0.3097314317782773,0.136440539107598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13136405491322262,0.0,0.0,0.10314069049538416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11457172351665927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10470410208396327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3959478576976052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3127570663693876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11895403572785868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17688395639967067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11617687057233846,0.0,0.13505387399610866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09009957517401164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11248955443390148,0.0,0.0,0.10976379767353626,0.0,0.0,0.09950329651370443
teaching,historynerd86,2018/02/14,"Does having a master's really affect employability with no experience? So I plan on going through a combined program that offers initial licensure AND MA in Elementary Education through WGU. They also offer only the licensure, but everyone that has gone through is telling me that they take about the same amount of time and money to complete and the only difference is the MA requires completion of a capstone project. If cost is the same I would prefer having a degree to go along with it. I hear mixed things about this, however. In your experience, is it difficult to find a job with a masters but no experience in teaching. I am in the last semester of my undergrad and can't sub because I don't have a degree yet and have no para experience (I'm also moving so I likely won't be able to work as an aide until I am already enrolled in MA program).",6.455766871165642,7.021683319018407,7.851662576687119,67.80215644171781,65.50306748466258,10.691779141104297,36.545398773006134,10.577609850970193,4.1671698159509205,683,33,116,17,10,236,100,163,0.069,0.931,0.0,-0.8573,3,0,0,0,0,0,12.0,0,1,2,5,7,2,0,0,14,0,16,0,0,1,0,19,22,14,0,3,3,3,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,7,9,0,1,2,0,2,4,6,1,0,0,1,1,12,1,24,18,3,14,0,0,0,0,10,6,0,1,5,91,19,9,0.15829320524272206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17468048819524462,0.2531740380856899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0964940686915509,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3319348280854698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16538270848731712,0.0,0.0,0.13852345062699215,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1512559411157043,0.0,0.6193645152482082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14467712186864234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17992335281557054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17840794670828394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15708158116114385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1290300893854862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07733406438295523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16824062610285884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2407782311042057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10140668060766088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11901679051006965,0.0,0.13835523843758385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10516297188013242,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09230204093726753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11523933867967713,0.0,0.0,0.11244695135049876,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,NewTeacherFears,2018/02/15,"Is it possible to be a new teacher without participating in extracurricular activities? I am currently a student teacher and have started putting together my application portfolio to apply for jobs. I've had a number of professors and teachers tell me that I need to be up front about what extracurricular activities I would be willing to sponsor or coach. One even said that I won't get any good job offers unless I am willing to sponsor or coach. 

This is concerning to me as two friends and I started a small business last semester. Something I was looking forward to about teaching is being able to leave before 4pm and pursue other interests. 

My schedule for student teaching has gone like this: 

- Get there at 6:45. Make copies, prep for lessons, catch up on emails/meetings/whatever

- Teach from 7:50 - 3:00. 

- Plan, meetings, etc until 4:00 at the latest. 

- Use the rest of my afternoon and evening how I want. Sometimes I grade at 9pm watching a TV show. Sometimes I grade Saturday morning. Sometimes I get my planning and grading done during my planning period. 

I told my cooperating teacher that I didn't want to coach or sponsor any clubs and talked to her about our small business. Her exact words were, ""Oh honey, your ass belongs to the school until you get tenured."" 

Starting salary = $36k/year in my state. I knew ahead of time that you don't get into teaching for the money, but I figured if I did my job well, I could spend the extra afternoon hours pursuing other interests if I wanted. 

Sorry if I'm coming off as angry, but I don't think it's fair that this is the next three years of my life. I can teach English and supposedly I'm good at it. I don't know anything about sports! Or debate team! 

And why should I have to work so many extra hours for so little pay? They said being a volleyball coach pays $800 a YEAR. 

Is this the reality of being a new teacher?

teaching,urbangriever,2018/02/15,"Advice For Supporting a Student Whose Parent Died I’m at a loss. I feel like my IQ has plummeted. I want to support this family and this child as much as I can. This isn’t something I’ve dealt with before.

I teach kindergarten and one of my students had her father in the hospital for a while. I just received news that he passed away (significantly sooner than expected because he was given a few months to live). She was unaware that he was dying, they just told her that he was very sick.

Are there any teachers here who have had a parent of a young student pass? What did you do? Any advice or guidance is greatly appreciated.

The family invited me to the funeral so I’ll attend. But when she comes back to my classroom I want to support her but not overwhelm her or make it worse.

We have very few resources here. I did refer them to one that’s an outside resource (they offer free grief counseling for children. It’s a great place).",2.649100241545895,4.983970733695653,3.852101449275363,85.65183574879228,78.07608695652175,6.480193236714977,25.439613526570053,7.594959193182576,1.4410577294685993,741,28,142,11,18,241,119,184,0.094,0.777,0.128,0.6583,2,0,1,0,0,0,20.0,1,1,3,1,8,10,0,1,11,0,16,1,0,1,0,19,27,11,4,3,7,3,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,12,5,0,0,2,0,1,5,2,3,0,2,10,1,22,8,18,17,3,14,0,3,0,0,25,4,0,2,6,100,34,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27307189811547056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19003321133303827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312745987960043,0.10743855956957914,0.0,0.08517400023697085,0.0,0.11889420009217175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12035921344584324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2900213613715429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26343730216481404,0.0,0.07064827664988207,0.09981832229008086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3080907668945267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06826172538267626,0.0,0.12337819524979295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09326635861576814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11152577022073948,0.0,0.1027126702178228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18936018920567424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31029228219890004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14598106435865355,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10756578903729434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4756688867011562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13351155919866708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2305726390661033,0.16482479345875564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1423899351631937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Carsonian,2018/02/15,"Co-teaching woes I am a recent university graduate, and I am currently working as an “associate teacher” at the Child Development Laboratory on campus. Before January, I was employed at this facility as a student worker. I’m coming in on my 4th school year with these kids, and I am now in a preschool room covering another teacher’s maternity leave. 

My classroom has a head teacher and a supervising teacher, then there’s me. I LOVE my kids, and it is a joy seeing them everyday, but I come home and cry almost every night because of the way that I am treated in the classroom. The two other teachers that I work with are extremely unwelcoming. I am far beyond uncomfortable in my own class, because I genuinely feel like I have a target on my back. 

I am at a loss. I know that I am not a bad teacher. Kids love me, and most other coworkers enjoy working with me. Nevertheless, I walk in every day feeling like I can’t do anything right. In my four years here, I have NEVER had an experience like this. My co-teachers are bossy, disrespectful, and I can tell that they think very highly of themselves. My guess is that they still view me and treat me as a student, even though I have a teaching degree and could very well apply for and potentially get a “real teaching job” if there were any open in my area right now. 

Context: The head teacher in my room pulled me aside for an unwarranted performance review. She rattled off a list of things I need to do better, all of which she provided examples for. The things she mentioned have happened once or twice in the past month of my working there. For example, she mentioned that I “Really need to match my actions to my words.” Because she saw me talk to a kid about running on concrete, but I was “dancing around with her”, so I wasn’t being firm. I had actually just helped the child off the ground, and was just beginning to talk to her about being safe when the head teacher pulled the child away from me and gave her a stern talking-to herself. 

The head teacher also mentioned that I shouldn’t talk so much about myself, because then the conversations that I have with kids are all about me. This is a “suggestion” that really offended me, because when I do talk about myself, I am answering questions that kids have about me or my life. The kids do not know me nearly as well as they know either of the other teachers, and are curious about who I am and what I do. I feel that I am creating positive relationships with these children, but she apparently feels that I am a self-centered chatter bug. 

The last point the teacher made was that I am “always late” because I wash my hand in the classroom sink when I come in, so I start “working” roughly 1 minute after I’m supposed to. What bugs me is that she and the other teacher consistently take LONG lunches, and don’t release me until 5-10 minutes in to my designated lunch break time slot. They also hang out and talk/laugh in their office while I supervise the children throughout their entire nap time...but I’m not supposed to say anything about that because I’m just an associate teacher.

How in the world do I navigate this? I want to respect my co-teachers, and I want them to respect me, but I genuinely feel that I can not be myself in their classroom because I feel so uncomfortable. I know that it affects my teaching. I am much less personable and enthusiastic when they are criticizing me. They have driven other teachers to quit with this same behavior, and I don’t want that to happen to me. I just can’t get over it.

teaching,MonkeyPilot,2018/02/16,"Lost the joy (student teacher) I'm a bit more than halfway through my teacher prep program and year- long internship, as a second career mid-life. I was excited to get started, but as the year has gone on,  I have lost my motivation and enthusiasm. This is not my first time teaching- I have taught ay all levels from middle school through community college for the past three years. Now I'm interning at a high school and finding it difficult to pick up steam.  

What is getting to me are the endless lists of things I have to keep in mind during lessons: the various assessments, the learning targets, the regulations and standards.  My classes do nothing to prepare me for the actual classroom practice; interesting,  but a complete waste of time. I used to enjoy teaching and watching students grow.  But now i feel as if I'm just checking boxes,  and I don't have time for anything but shoveling more work through. I'm sure it shows up in the classroom as students lose focus,  and I'm stiff and mechanical, constantly stressed by unceasing observation.   Is this ""normal"" for teacher prep,  and I should just power through to certification? Or did I get an unrealistic picture in my earlier years and simply buy in to the wrong profession? 

Thanks for your thoughts.",6.976695778748184,8.194131851528388,6.956139737991268,72.38212809315868,64.54585152838429,9.774788937409026,39.72081513828239,9.888512548439397,4.22479190684134,1010,56,168,21,15,322,139,229,0.092,0.8,0.108,0.5733,1,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,1,0,8,4,12,0,1,15,0,14,1,0,3,2,35,32,20,0,3,9,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,6,10,0,2,6,1,2,2,2,6,0,3,7,2,17,6,34,24,5,27,0,3,1,0,1,11,0,2,14,114,23,18,0.0,0.0,0.14922826108961004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12584046773623914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16694948164071896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16033414041371533,0.16525263719915392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07732115402153611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13976648431942312,0.13007402259514975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23968380794560035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16156880903907886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13592268664358273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13532975069263894,0.0,0.17107882322267842,0.33386138346623123,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15440602135403134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1498295336864809,0.1467312576458182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1459798346147969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30952723782732955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10823785324888324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17516981294854986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1441256766514674,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1407885679889576,0.0,0.0,0.10159352543392138,0.0,0.0,0.12140172413511903,0.26750736240846146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13207413559637787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11132787972639896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1671944624464763,0.0,0.3939029212945101

teaching,scumbagotron,2018/02/17,"Last summer I worked teaching art/tech camp to kids; I was asked to come back this summer but I have doubts and concerns, help please? For context I am female, I work as a website designer, and I had had no teaching training or experience prior to last summer. I was 23 at the time.

-----

Last summer was really great when it was great but it also completely drained me, by the end. Helping five really passionate older kids collaborate on writing and directing and editing their own movie? Amazing. Wrangling 15+ 7-year-olds into following boring programming instructions with no help from my coworker? Exhausting.

And near the end we got a child whose scabs were still healing from the physically abusive situation he had just gotten out of, who usually has an aide in school (we did not get an aide) - as terribly as I feel for the kid, the experience was honestly kind of horrible for me. I hope to one day be the kind of person that could handle that but I'm not there yet. Monday was a holiday that week and it was still the longest week of my life.

Worst of all was the battle with myself - they have fun when I'm having fun, and I can't reliably make myself have fun. And trying to stay empathetic and compassionate with the problem kids was hard and I know I started slipping near the end.

I also caught myself thinking, after I overheard a minor altercation on the playground, ""that can be [coworker]'s problem"" once near the end of the summer.

Last year also I noticed a trend where, though I had more experience than the other two employees, I would be assigned to 'artsy' classes, classes with younger kids, or, if assigned to a programming class, I would be ""support"" to one of my male coworkers. It happened often enough that it's hard for me to chalk it up to coincidence or my own insecurity, especially since I really do have more experience than either of the others. Then again, I can think of reasonable things that would explain the separate incidents. Whatever. Anyway my problem is that this is not something I would bring up with her - not worth it, especially since I doubt she even realizes she's doing it - but it still bugs me and is a slight part of the reason I'm hesitant to return this year.

-----

So in summation I'm trying to figure out how to bring up these points with her:

- smaller class sizes, especially if they're young
- have appropriate support for students with needs
- two weeks on, one week off? To help prevent the burnout I experienced last year (it was really bad near the end)
- Also, need August partially off for a trip

...without being too demanding or sensitive.

She's been a big influence in my life and has apparently been in my corner looking for career opportunities for me...I'm just scared that if I go into this again this year without saying anything I'll end up messed up again. Last summer had a lot of great moments and I discovered that I really love teaching but it was not a net positive for me. 

I know I'm a good teacher though, I had so much fun with the kids and several parents told my boss about how much their kids loved having me, and seeing them really GET something I was teaching was so amazing. Teaching is not something I'd pursue as a career (I'm not tough enough) but it is something I want to keep doing. I just need to figure out how to make it work for me without annoying anybody.

Annnd it's also my best bet for solid employment for the summer...

teaching,Gazcobain,2018/02/17,"The Seven Year Itch I'm coming up for my seventh year teaching. I'm a High School teacher in Scotland, I teach Mathematics. I am strongly considering leaving the profession. I don't particularly enjoy it any more. The only thing that's keeping me going is that I get a steady, relatively good pay each month.

I used to love teaching. Up until a year ago I still did. But I've had various problems at home this year, including the death of my father and grandfather, and an ongoing battle with our local authority to ensure our autistic daughter is educated correctly (long story, but she's not).

I am getting so despondent with the sheer apathy of many of my pupils to their learning. A real unwillingness for the majority to take any kind of responsibility for their own learning. I try my best to make my lessons fun and engaging. I put on study support, Saturday classes, Easter school, you name it. I attend school social functions, I arrange trips, I (think, anyway!) have a reputation as being a decent, fair and kind teacher.

But I don't know how much longer I can go on. I'm sick of fighting stupid, silly behaviour from children who are seemingly given no kind of school-linked sanctions at home. I'm sick of fighting the scourge of mobile phones in school and the pictures regularly taken of staff and shared around Snapchat (of course, no-one knows who originally took the picture). My school's management team are great, but our local authority are a nightmare and push unrealistic targets on us.

I've been flirting with the idea of working from home. I do a bit of web design and development, and I enjoy private tuition (the drawback to private tuition is that it would be unsociable hours).

teaching,toguideyouhome,2018/02/17,"How do you cope? I teach first grade. Yesterday, at the end of the day, we had the fire alarm go off unexpectedly. My first thought was, it's a shooter. I was standing in the doorway, my door already locked and ready to close it, my body blocking the way into the classroom, waiting to hear if it was a shooter or a fire or what we needed to do. My kids kept coming over to see what was going on and I had to keep shooing them away from the door because I didn't want them anywhere near the hallway. I was ready to grab the mom standing in the hallway, shut the door, break a window, and get my kids out. After only a minute or two, they told us it was a false alarm because someone was working on the alarm system, but I was still shushing my kids and listening for shots the rest of the day. I would die for my students without a second thought, but I didn't sign up for this. This is only my third year teaching, I hope to have a long career ahead of me and the way things are going, it seems inevitable that I will be at a school where there is a shooting someday.",6.2967272727272725,4.849453036363637,6.370000000000001,85.01500000000003,66.36363636363637,8.545454545454545,33.18181818181818,6.11248444174946,1.7522272727272732,828,29,181,3,11,264,123,220,0.08,0.885,0.035,-0.7514,0,0,0,3,0,0,24.0,3,1,3,4,4,4,0,3,25,0,21,1,1,1,0,31,39,12,1,5,7,1,3,0,0,2,0,2,4,3,11,11,0,4,3,0,0,4,3,3,0,5,16,6,26,1,30,20,1,37,0,0,1,0,14,16,0,6,11,134,37,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17763217723965707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15123472326301654,0.0,0.0,0.1962491826017216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17879914679016828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13865966839420646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20762207113960252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16705935774958033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14256985934453562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2738385763531109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08409912990723364,0.0,0.2744454508951748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18142262102695408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15987753210303068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1430757435726317,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1424516038196067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18852376182436129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1193557233221425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24484681640658315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16290819730577644,0.12827064566635932,0.1465392105416126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13638765368654654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1285492429732696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10693997854632338,0.0,0.0,0.2555812039998656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15381181045695838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15724233449927394,0.0,0.19362466983576515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09494308973038544,0.25553779251597675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15516739606549235,0.0,0.1171866122245389,0.0,0.0,0.11434704012290856,0.0,0.0,0.10365810658861167

teaching,miss_katticus,2018/02/17,"Where do I start? **I've also posted this in r/primaryteaching

I am a beginning teacher that hasn’t achieved (gained? not sure of the right term) a job. I feel a bit like I am in a holding pattern. I DO work but in a position that used to be, but no longer has anything to do with teaching or working with kids. I now don’t feel like I have an ‘edge’ and I do not feel like I have the connections to put myself ahead of other job applicants.

So what do I do?

I am keen to volunteer, as I’ve done in the past, but I don’t want to be a reading mum, or work in the school canteen, and be just another parent helper.

I live in a regional town in Australia, and jobs seem to be scarce, but??? I just don't know. I am so keen to get to teaching, or at the very least, working with kids, but I just don’t know how to start.

Does anyone have any ideas?",1.199304029304031,2.4370830329670348,3.2112307692307698,93.65043589743591,78.56043956043956,6.611575091575091,23.122344322344322,7.3011,0.6086933333333331,640,20,157,8,15,217,92,182,0.026,0.853,0.122,0.943,4,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,0,0,7,9,7,0,0,13,0,24,0,0,2,1,31,36,16,0,1,13,2,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,6,0,1,7,1,0,1,8,0,0,0,1,3,17,7,24,31,3,20,0,0,0,0,5,11,0,4,10,107,22,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11782883646670204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10019718084352994,0.15450026827592442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030245083608291,0.0,0.12124938920942085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1608586096500753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12893942154690227,0.15078137236398567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2235006639770852,0.21052140138744627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697978199324806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16633046678652147,0.0,0.0,0.4386407092571527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16194992193887978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21595064551762228,0.0,0.13010512483448866,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16360514930912806,0.0,0.14065400504578074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14111229888560292,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14811876792032022,0.0,0.0,0.14738123780245171,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1258287207670422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.149117327698215,0.0,0.13413404506561655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20857795321093955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13886749292773382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272556321467916,0.0,0.12157205707368784,0.08690575464065314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.42906507458628906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Roguehistorian,2018/02/18,"Tips for teaching adult ed in a prison I haven't taught in years, but have accepted a position to teach adult Ed in the state prison system. 
I am certified elementary education and special education.  
I will be teaching GED classes, mainly math and science. I'm super excited about getting back to education. After I got my Masters in Special education I expected to be hired on pretty quickly.  No one would give me a chance with little experience, and since we needed insurance... Well I was out of field for a while.
I'm pretty tough, I was a firefighter for 11 years so Im not a delicate flower, as I'm told... LOL...  I've seen some stuff...
Im required to go thru the 3 week basic detention officer training (no range and no PT test) and I'm very apprehensive about this part because I'm woefully out of shape.  
I'd love some tips and suggestions for getting thru basic in one piece and some tips and suggestions for the classroom experience in a high security, male prison. 
I'm hoping a few years here, if I'm not in love with the job, will help me back into public school...

teaching,empoweredmyself,2018/02/18,"What's next for my 2nd graders? Grit! (Brainstorming publicly, so ideas are very welcome) I'm going to start some lessons on grit with my 2nd graders. 

We have already worked on goal setting.  My next step toward grit will be making commitments to themselves and sticking to them. In their journals, I'm going to have them commit to something that is a challenge for them and stick to it (we'll track it) . We will discuss what they can do when they are not successful and how to redouble their efforts to keep the needle moving forward. I will discuss personal examples. We'll talk about character. I even think there is a short video by the kid President I can show.

 I have been working very hard to set them up for their future selves,  future struggles,  future goals,  really maximizing my effectiveness in the year I have them.

 They have already transformed so much. I had students who came to me as runners (elopers),  some with major character flaws, and many with self-doubt. They are now hard workers, accomplishing more than others expect (so I've been told, which is a little ridiculous to me-their expectations should be higher then, especially because our population is made up of kids whose lives are unstable), and most importantly, the kids are kind to one another,  helpful, empathetic, and calm (well behaved too,  but what I mean is an inner peace). Because of this,  we accomplish a lot. The lessons are so rigorous and the discussions are deep and thoughtful. 

I am very proud of how far they have come. I have to always ask though, what's next? My commitment to them is to give them the tools for their future selves, which starts with never giving up on themselves/always challenging themselves to do better.  What's next for your students?",6.1882759566588925,7.927538917981074,5.679854615279115,78.88918529694143,66.76025236593061,8.667617610752982,32.07913866410643,9.085049710711278,2.8528275682348103,1395,58,240,25,23,427,175,317,0.044,0.847,0.109,0.9629,0,0,2,0,0,0,52.0,6,1,16,16,14,11,1,1,12,0,36,0,0,5,4,42,54,19,0,3,2,0,2,0,0,6,0,0,0,4,14,17,0,1,7,3,0,8,2,2,1,1,7,2,38,9,41,39,7,39,0,0,0,0,40,15,0,4,16,171,52,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2600683527575954,0.0,0.19609680732185528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12356057933251124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11016009269273,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14366260224462246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1042157411900476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13477218391920165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10150467137646757,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07782909993067506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260767013111496,0.133937025459501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21111455527361653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07898251327530495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1330217032379884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10473742293970847,0.0,0.12270732504703595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11810192038525225,0.1040507228762087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1001793525815058,0.0,0.1114986037118703,0.07865597332133674,0.11946649248260448,0.0,0.12835717906490554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12524026853122835,0.08662249891945982,0.0,0.0908818425517402,0.0,0.5012766851864601,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07984824437954778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1028892330395216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07548830626913691,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12292790989312605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09071536573719677,0.0,0.0,0.166808854264942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12318703340108207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09471154527816232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.075504098002069,0.11577257744004027,0.093548060594858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11259667252244357,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29167937318742065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10594808017708524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17157099394982206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07588206553956757
teaching,sah9,2018/02/18,"New to teaching high school - HELP?! I have taught college level Spanish for 7 years, but 3 weeks ago I started teaching freshman at an urban charter school. Their previous teacher had health issues and left at the end of December, then they had a sub for 3 weeks until I started. 

It was a complete shit show the first week. I have made some progress in some of my classes, but others are a nightmare. I have students who play games on their phones, others who are jumping on each others backs and throwing pencils at each other. Many of the girls just sing loudly and braid hair the entire class period. If it was one or two students causing trouble it would be much easier to isolate the problem and deal with them, but it's whole groups.

My mentor teacher told me they need love and respect, wear them down with kindness she said. The other teachers are telling me to write them up until they start following my expectations. I don't want to make things worse by writing up everything that happens (it would be multiple write ups per class) but I can't let them keep ruining the whole class period for those who actually want a good grade. I called for help one day last week and the entire principal/vice principal team came down and gave them a stern talking to. It helped that day, but the next day was terrible again.

We now have a week off for February break and I'm going to return with a clear set of expectations that they'll hopefully follow. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or just commiseration...",6.285251826220688,6.93375990311419,6.064746251441754,80.17805747789312,65.88581314878893,8.913571703191083,31.972510572856606,8.841846274778883,2.5445753940792013,1208,46,224,18,18,377,170,289,0.101,0.774,0.125,0.9133,0,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,1,0,11,3,5,12,1,0,17,0,20,5,3,3,2,47,44,20,0,11,12,0,1,0,0,3,1,2,0,1,19,15,0,1,0,5,0,6,3,5,0,4,11,4,26,7,34,27,7,50,0,1,1,1,35,15,1,7,27,150,45,16,0.0,0.0,0.10859496330718314,0.0,0.0,0.10874326610412437,0.0986445823552713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08556881871585499,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11363113798168542,0.12727670889454998,0.0,0.11431704058115112,0.0,0.0,0.1166768276195402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21530262322201515,0.11472662735228005,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.098562625642476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1000128870996398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0946562240141353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0632439992581513,0.09333787614695817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09840610928697822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11828732686285992,0.0,0.0,0.22376949139432928,0.11757530886624835,0.0,0.11052791535154108,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11614926492661147,0.0,0.09891235789318806,0.0,0.11588284789243795,0.0,0.09070950212604853,0.0,0.0,0.12090797803621064,0.11379315817199853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09344866697736952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10043614990161392,0.10529750957580662,0.07428145132113527,0.11282225711707132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08180491150384757,0.08251402877278746,0.0,0.10747663519584087,0.1183494339869713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15081482632542906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10648163317118586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10585445470304326,0.0,0.0,0.2252462019526468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11422914655302968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23629744693505225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10488175934845602,0.0,0.0,0.0894440783459337,0.09726517942423164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0739306689375623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633450831163856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10870612780046164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1312737524391007,0.0,0.4463176518282322,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24848426337236146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11340563944410482,0.15810276534991036,0.0,0.0,0.07166181689084197
teaching,Karboxyl,2018/02/18,"Student teacher not coping I am a teaching student at the tail end of a bachelor of education. I've been studying to become a high school teacher (chem major, math minor) and am currently on a 3 week practicum. I am not enjoying it at all. I've been given the textbook and program for the classes I'm taking and basically been given free reign when it comes to planning. I feel like planning takes up all my time (even though I'm only taking 2 classes) and I am just miserable all the time. Behaviour management terrifies me, and I feel like the students have no respect for me (and that this is my fault). I feel like my lessons are uninspired and boring. I feel like I don't have the ability to do this, and I wonder how everyone else copes. I'm supposed to complete a 10 week prac starting in April but I honestly just want to quit and study something else.

To add to the stress my mum keeps telling me that if I drop out/change to something else she will kick me out and my boyfriend will break up with me, among equally awful things.

teaching,singingintherain13,2018/02/18,"Teaching: NY to FL Hi all - I have a Master's degree in childhood general, special, and bilingual education in NY. I currently work a private school for students with language-based learning disabilities. Remediating dyslexia is really what I'm passionate about. 

I'm going to be moving to the greater Orlando area of FL and I'm trying to research job options/salaries (much lower than NY, I know). How does private school pay there compare to public? Would I be able to get a job as a reading specialist without a degree in literacy? Overall I'm not finding many specialized schools like mine for elementary-aged kids. 

I'd be willing to consider a non-teaching position that's still in the education field, or even a career change altogether. I'm mainly looking to do something I like while also maximizing salary potential, since my partner has massive student loans to pay off.

Any tips, thoughts, suggestions? Thanks!

I’m a pre-service teacher, and I’m trying to be more proactive with my resume. I’ve completed on internship at a junior high school, and I am currently placed in a high school. I will have one more before I begin student-teaching. Should I include these experiences? If so, should I include them separately or lump them together?

teaching,allahere,2018/02/20,"What's it like being a high school counsellor? I'm a substitute teacher right now, which means here that I'm completely certified. I don't care about being a classroom teacher, but I love working in school and with the high school age group.

I've been looking into becoming a counsellor. This would require getting a Masters. I think I would be good at talking to students. But I'm not really sure what school counsellors actually do. I know they talk to students. I know they deal with course changes. I know they probably have to do paperwork.

But what do they do on daily basis?

The other thing I'm considering is becoming a teacher-librarian. This is a diploma program. I like books and helping students with random things. I also have a teachable subject which could help get a teacher-librarian job, French.",4.074200000000001,6.837419353333335,4.908666666666665,77.68100000000003,75.46666666666667,8.0,32.66666666666667,8.841846274778883,3.3174666666666672,653,34,108,15,15,211,88,150,0.033,0.815,0.151,0.9562,1,0,0,0,0,0,20.0,0,0,4,3,4,6,0,0,11,0,16,1,0,0,1,21,30,6,0,3,4,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,12,6,0,1,5,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,13,6,11,23,0,9,0,0,1,1,11,7,0,1,4,72,25,13,0.0,0.0,0.13312051072928915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1090903286928251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30131737321713314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13908329478683015,0.0,0.1443080593131085,0.0,0.14302761757974675,0.0,0.0,0.10891558090596552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14063697580690782,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14254150294895973,0.0,0.0,0.11441769824925505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18287102871603134,0.2882580312892577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13536997276678067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22490891125470505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13329010456962068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11455351055103526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12311907627581388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14859497631373955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14707750205478576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08739038333301635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11649691976168715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5522335204248936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12856870102859858,0.0,0.0,0.2192890172528592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812549699876421,0.08740866491413314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09931110970118344,0.0,0.0,0.19380936491094947,0.0,0.0,0.0

I'm interviewing for 1st, 3rd, and 4th grade. I'm sure I'm mainly viewed for the 4th grade spot but I will still be considered for the 1st and would love to take on the opportunity of a lower grade.

This position is at my kids' school. My son is in 1st now with the retiring teacher so I have a little idea of work they do. I do not know specific curriculum and philosophy but will be going through the grade level website and his parent-teacher conference info. 

But I'm terrified about literacy questions! I have not been in a primary grade in ages. Could you post some questions you've been asked or ask during interviews? What are responses you are looking for?

Thank you in advance.",3.6591455696202537,6.359846607594937,5.139731012658231,75.80174841772157,76.59493670886077,8.760126582278481,26.96360759493671,9.354420925462401,2.8565430379746837,676,27,119,19,16,226,93,158,0.051,0.843,0.106,0.8308,2,0,0,0,0,0,17.0,0,3,1,3,4,4,0,0,8,0,17,1,0,0,1,22,29,11,0,2,6,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,2,7,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,12,4,19,21,2,20,0,0,2,1,16,13,0,4,4,75,14,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3197704367078167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13654948631302133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3345903878273916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09719740623765176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11463440228201616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1930663232767792,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09399082617807766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1714119048672344,0.0,0.0,0.14361786340378754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15435667221305027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13007216226015872,0.0,0.0,0.18990293995147653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16379460264452894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3831741141373182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5192590645315127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13658072615225664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16118896796359078,0.0,0.1285894594034892,0.0,0.0,0.1574567731611816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12450818241130045,0.0,0.0,0.1214911998866892,0.0,0.0,0.11013444452865843
teaching,Northern_Vagabond,2018/02/20,"Question about becoming a teacher, Hello all, 

I’ve given serious consideration and decided I want to go through with my lifelong ambition to become a teacher. My question is;

Is a bachelors degree good enough with the proper certifications?

What do I need to study in college to be qualified to teach?

What area of teaching is in highest demand? (History and English were my best subjects but I’ve been told the greatest need is for Science).

I’m still working on my associates degree in liberal arts since I figure it’d be a good stepping stone in to my bachelors.

What is the job market for teachers like right now? I know they don’t make that much in the way of money but for me that’s not the point. 

Also if I’m able to become a teacher, I want to move to the Southwest, preferably NM, AZ, UT, etc..

Thanks for any help you can offer!

What is the job mar

As i said everything went great  Except for the math class. Its embarrassing to admit but i had no clue what any if the material was. I was attempting to do a work sheet along with the students and found myself struggling to even recall basic concepts. Does anyone have any advice on how i can improve and fix this? I feel that this will severely hinder my ability since i can't teach what i don't understand.

I have a prelim license in MA and am currently in the classroom. My license is expiring in two years, though. I have a degree in something other than education and it seems like my only option is to go back and get another degree. I was looking into state approved schools. None seem like they are online only. I called the DOE in MA and they said they couldn't tell me if there are any online only options that are state approved.

teaching,xtinerae,2018/02/20,"Adding an Endorsemenr: is it worth it? Hi! I am a new teacher. I have my bachelors in English Lit and my M.Ed. I worked for several years in another industry before transitioning to teaching. 

I have had a hard time with the work amoint and some of my classes. I feel like teaching for me goes in waves. There a moments where I can see myself doing this long term, and others where I see it as me just building a resume and moving on. 

I have wondered if adding and endorsement could help me work in a different role in our school beyond classroom teaching, and if I might enjoy that more. Still, I don’t know if I want to take out more loans to go back to school. I know there are also options for me to do something outside of classroom teaching by leaving teaching all together. I have several friends who have teaching degrees, and work in education, but are not in a traditional brick and mortar.

If I got an endorsemenr, I have looked into being a reading specialists, library media, and ELL. I wrote a similar post and some people suggested not to take the ELL route for various reasons. I’d be curious if there were new perspectives here as I am getting ready to talk to my supervisor about this. I am doing my own research, but would like some outside thoughts. 

Thanks for your time and any thoughts you might have!

teaching,HippedMojarra,2018/02/21,"What were you like as a student? Hi, 

I’m just a college student at the moment, but I’m curious what you teachers were like as students (at any age, I guess).

Were you ever the slacker? Were you the go getting over achiever? Just kind of average? Did you enjoy school? Or did you think it was pointless at times?

Do you think the type of student a person was has any indication on how well they’ll teach or enjoy teaching? Or could it just indicate that they didn’t mesh well with the teacher?

The reason I’m asking is because I’m interested in being a teacher but haven’t exactly been the ideal student.

teaching,MrsLilysMom,2018/02/21,"Today was a good day This year has been sparse as far as grand success goes, but I had a little success that I wanted to share. Something that made my day better and I think made my student's day better.

I have one kid this year total Eeyore personality, always down about something, nothing is going to be good enough for mom who had to give up so much for him that the least he can do is get good grades. It hurt my heart to hear him say that at the beginning of the year so I always look out for him. Well today was a bad day. He walks in looking like he's about to cry, total hang dog. Apparently some kids were razzing him in the class before mine.

So we're going through a power point today and I tell him he's going to be my 'clicker'. The kids always compete to see who can flip through the slides, and you have to earn it. Only kids who are totally finished the notes can be the 'clickers'. Well I tell Eeyore that he's my 'clicker' today, he looks up at me with watery eyes and says that he doesn't deserve it, he hasn't finished. I whisper and grin that it doesn't matter because I make the rules, I'm still empress of my classroom (it's medieval history). 

By the end of class he's smiling and his whole demeanor is turned around. I know I can't always fix his problems and sometimes all I can do is listen. But today, doing things like that to make kids feel special, to turn to turn just one day around. I live for that feeling.

teaching,Twentycharmax,2018/02/21,"[Student] I have a question concerning IEP I am currently enrolled in high school; I wanted to ask the teachers here a question about IEP...


A few days ago, I had my IEP removed; one of the accommodations was that I had extra time on quizzes and tests; although, I wasn’t allowed more time on a mathematics test (***before*** the IEP was removed), and wasn’t allowed the extra time, now that my IEP is removed; however, I’m not allowed that extra time (the IEP was removed a few days after the quiz), and my teacher hearing the news just now decided to hand back the quizzes and tell me that I can’t finish it, coincidentally I wasn’t able to finish it before.


What should I do here?",4.045681818181818,5.5216837196969735,5.291333333333334,80.63700000000003,71.65151515151516,7.4012121212121205,31.381818181818186,7.908726449838941,2.214312727272727,529,24,101,7,10,176,68,132,0.0,0.972,0.028,0.4939,5,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,13,0,14,1,1,3,0,15,18,5,0,2,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,7,4,0,0,3,0,0,4,5,0,0,1,8,2,13,0,9,9,6,22,0,0,0,0,5,4,0,2,14,75,20,5,0.20737803970482035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1838281197234042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19387047314640968,0.0,0.0,0.15946091185055225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3529268753489114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2674833593048617,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2337301225241761,0.0,0.0,0.21910628479259764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14052472668983773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4646217303267195,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20987764756642294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812575472591129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4836952105675982,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1223169407976412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,__clurr,2018/02/21,"Evaluation? Hello teachers of Reddit! 

My summative is coming up (I’m a First Year) and I’m a bit concerned about what is an “okay” score. I’m very close to proficient, but depending on my evidence and objectives, it could go higher or lower. 

Is being “Needs Improvement” as a first year okay? Is “Proficient” where I need to be? Am I overthinking this? 

Thanks!

teaching,Brades88,2018/02/22,"Looking for a good (fairly simple) career test Hi everyone,

I’m working with quite an apathetic group this year and am looking for some sort of career test to help possibly give students ideas of things that they could aim for. One that spits out a career instead of just personality traits would make my life easier too. 

Something with less than 100 questions and the flashier it looks the better. (I can remember doing one in HS but don’t remember what t was called - from Canada)

I’ve looked at 8 or 10 and haven’t found anything I really like yet. 

I know these aren’t exactly a science but I was trying to do a unit on their “future selves” and I had so many responses if “I don’t know or care” that a jumping off point could at least help. 

Any help is appreciated! Thanks!

teaching,iteachonmars,2018/02/22,"How do I resign? So, I’m giving my notice tomorrow. 
It’s already decided. My physical health is declining rapidly and it’s not fair to my kids if I’m out this often. Technically I’m still on my probationary contract, which says I am able to leave at any time with no repercussions. However, I may want to go back to teaching eventually and I don’t want to burn any bridges. 
How should I go about resigning without making them hate me? Is two weeks notice enough time? 
*I can either leave now and get most of my colon removed, or wait and struggle/be an absolute shit teacher till the end of the year. I made the decision to leave now.

teaching,out_in_the_woods,2018/02/22,"HS English teachers of reddit! Help me help my GF who is student teaching New to Reddit and posting from mobile so I apologise for the formatting in advance.

*Backstory* my GF is I'm her final semester of becoming a highschool English teacher and she's been in love with the idea of being a teacher since being in HS herself. 

The trouble is she is now student teaching in a local HS and is struggling with actually working in the classroom. She feels like she drowning under grading papers and making assignments and can't get ahead of it. She is dealing with a class that ""absolutely hates"" her and is very discouraged when they don't listen. 

She is questioning if she's even cut out to be a teacher. I want to help her but there is only so much I can say. ANY tips, tricks, motivation that you've learned in your time teaching that I can pass onto her would be much appreciated!

teaching,YourQueenChristine,2018/02/23,"A special ed middle school student wandered out of the school today and into town. She was gone for an hour before anyone realized she was gone. I’m livid.

teaching,bloodofgore,2018/02/24,"Teaching IT Abroad questions I can't seem to find resources on teaching IT abroad, most of it is people teaching English. 

I'm 19 currently, I have experience in teaching through working at a Boy Scout Summer Camp teaching merit badge classes, two years as a Technology Instructor, one year as a Technology Director, and one year (this year) as the STEM Director. 

Now I plan on working in education as an IT teacher. This is something that really excites me and finding this as an opportunity is more than exciting. I just need more information before I put time and money into this.

Is this experience worth it as a resume builder? I'm not just doing it for the experience, although it's 90% of the reason I want to. 

Also I have not started college yet and I planned on starting this fall, would this be worth putting off college to do something like this?

Anyway, I currently really dislike teaching because it makes me feel so anxious and insecure. I’m not bad at it per se, I just don’t feel like it’s what I was meant to do. 

However, I’m only 21. Part of me hopes that in a few years, the anxiety and insecurity will fade a bit and I’ll actually be able to be a teacher. Teaching college students is great, it’s the high school students I struggle with.

teaching,LowLevelRebel,2018/02/25,"Precalculus book with limits in each chapter? I'm trying to convince my math department to switch books for their grade 11 precalculus course, as the book right now is WAY too similar to the one used for the grade 10 math course.  Most of the topics are exactly the same, which creates a problem as the kids think that grade 12 will be more of the same and it ends up being completely different.  The other problem is that stuff like limits and introduction to derivatives isn't until the end of the book, and we never make it that far, so our precalculus course feels like just another algebra.

I remember at my last school we used a book that had limits at the end of each chapter for the topic covered (so linear functions with limits of lines, then quadratic functions with limits of those, etc), but I can't for the life of me remember what it was called.

Can anyone help me out?

teaching,wannabe_artteacher,2018/02/27,"Student Teacher with a Management Problem I feel as if I've completely lost control of one of the classes. (specifically one particular 7th grade class and one 8th grade class) I'll go ahead and say that I've answered at least one of my questions by writing and re-writing this post, and that is some organizational and flow issues with my teaching. However, I've been noticing a general lack of respect and the students being off task and walking around even WHEN they have everything they need to work on. I've been bad about warnings with little follow through, and I spent literally all class period running around putting out little fires... while being observed. It's not just one or two students any more, I've let it go too long and the attitude is seeping into every one of them. The issue is we literally have a week left of the nine weeks and I'm struggling with dealing with the mess I have created but still being an effective teacher for what little time I still have these kids until the next 9 week batch comes in. I talked with some administration at the school about some potential tactics I can use and I was thinking of using the sticky note technique where I mark a strike on it, and three strikes, you're out. Administration even said that if I need to send a three-striker out to make a point, that'd be ok considering my difficulty. However, I'm looking for options for whole-class. The countdown (5, 4, 3.. etc) is one technique I may try to get everyone settled, but I admit I'm worried I've lost this class to the point that won't work. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for me, or is this just going to be about putting out my little fires right off the bat in the class to nip it in the bud and just streamline my teaching and flow from one activity to the other? I'm not even blaming the kids at this point. They were great and had a lot of potential. I've failed to pull it out of them.  I'm feeling a bit down about it all.

teaching,brienneofthrace,2018/02/27,"Anyone familiar with DC public schools? Hey all,

I'm an MST student finishing up a degree in childhood education. Trying to figure out where in the U.S. to look for teaching jobs. I'm a New Yorker, but I'm not certain I want to stay in the state. DC seems like a fun city to live in with the milder winters and cultural opportunities. 

I'm currently in the application process and am just curious to know if anyone has any insiders perspectives on the school system there. 

While I like the location, I don't currently have any ties stopping me from going anywhere in the country, and my desire to be at a school with a philosophy that aligns with mine is more important than location.

teaching,DragonBallFan2017,2018/02/27,"Difficulty Learning Certain Subjects and Terminology This is just based on my personal experience, so take this with a grain of salt.

I've noticed I'll have difficulty learning certain things (e.g. politics) because of confusion over terminology and misinformation on what certain words and concepts are. For example, ""scheme"", ""anarchy"", etc. As a result, I'd often get confused when trying to learn certain things. I thought anarchy was absolutely bad and was rebellion against government or was a country without a government. It's not that simple. I thought schemes were always bad, because they're virtually always used in a negative context. It's not that simple.

This can be applied to psychology to. ""Ego"" has been used in a negative context so much that people think it's bad. In actuality, everyone has an ego. It's a major part of the mind. When it becomes unhealthy, that's when problems occur.

I've figured out how to fix this now. I question my definitions of terms. Prior to this, people would look at me like I was an idiot or as if the subject was too difficult for me. That wasn't the problem. The problem was I was misinformed on so many terms and concepts, resulting in confusion. I was trying to put everything together in a big interconnected web, but since I was misinformed on so many terms and concepts, what I'd say would seem way out there. Once I fixed my definitions of terms and concepts, everything become much clearer.

I just thought this was worth noting. It's not always that students are slow learners nor dumb nor that the subject is too hard for them. It's that they're trying to put things together with faulty definitions and misinformation.",5.916302428256071,8.131991132450331,6.704917218543044,69.40397626931568,68.13907284768212,9.801545253863138,36.75551876379691,10.125756701596842,4.331880353200884,1350,73,216,36,24,445,148,302,0.145,0.7979999999999999,0.057,-0.9665,0,0,0,0,0,0,46.0,0,0,1,0,15,17,2,3,15,0,24,0,0,5,4,52,34,24,0,6,10,0,1,1,0,2,0,1,0,1,26,12,0,0,10,0,1,2,9,12,0,0,16,4,15,5,34,15,9,27,0,0,1,0,4,14,1,9,11,152,41,6,0.0,0.0,0.10994454907984008,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2812383053679723,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28221109397958305,0.13735877822058298,0.2488587412021604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12565098373500164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10765600182468407,0.2025116347843642,0.11020774934833738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05886268457441396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10092549112951614,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05504230851965696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09461001910260268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22844875686947624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11375928573467164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16564311702680645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12826957063829408,0.0,0.11998428740743393,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12200495088229585,0.0,0.1562151110093323,0.09837451863983997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3234148653241433,0.0,0.2265183945677932,0.12621031046893594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08959553544132379,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.102565761826659,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09319744982400313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08470987467869974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22454837163631805,0.0721910259884602,0.0,0.2683296927825713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2294759200059703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19461234992926454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08942803863905494,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10860480365148976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16006761930110502,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,ChocolateDelight,2018/02/27,Does it make sense for me to get a Masters in Education or should I just get the certification and get a Masters in another subject? I have recently decided to seriously pursue teaching (high school) as a career. I have a BA in Sociology from a pretty good school. I would want to teach history or art. I am looking into getting a Masters and I am unsure if I should actually get a Masters in education or if I should get a Masters in sculpture or something that I see myself getting more out of personal interest but maybe not for career growth. Would I receive the same pay bump if I did say a Masters in Sculpture and got a teaching certificate separately than if I did a masters program in education with a teaching certificate awarded in the program.,7.434423076923077,7.420256244755253,8.957473776223779,62.6792875874126,63.47552447552447,11.625524475524475,43.74912587412587,11.20814326018867,5.3707629370629375,605,37,99,16,8,213,75,143,0.056,0.86,0.084,0.546,0,0,1,0,0,0,8.0,0,0,0,8,1,4,0,0,15,0,11,0,0,1,0,26,23,13,0,10,11,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,0,1,2,6,0,0,1,1,1,2,1,1,0,0,3,3,14,3,20,15,2,14,0,0,2,0,3,11,0,8,1,78,16,15,0.0,0.0,0.1727565653721609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18563227407027852,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15492088334960874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6474391600617947,0.0,0.0,0.1484850716019722,0.14158773690296858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1870428048752836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14866132142750466,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11816946210294325,0.0,0.17785127595484074,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15457650336095308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1801040106615916,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17479659990813926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14078203153375765,0.0,0.3583293278749093,0.14107066129224616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13628699157840554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1044173776768258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2515152626409565,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Foreverlearning29,2018/02/27,"PhD help! Can you name any academics that are advocates of traditional forms of pedagogy? Hi all,

I’m in the first year of my PhD study. I intend to focus on how teachers perceptions of their pedagogy influences the way in which they teach controversial issues.

As part of my research, I need to complete a literature review - my review is looking at the different pedagogical perspectives. As you all probably know, it’s very easy to find literature regarding progressive and transformative pedagogies. However, I am finding it very difficult to even find a starting point for traditional forms of pedagogy.

Where do you suggest I start? Are there any contemporary academics (US/UK/EU) that are advocates of traditional forms of pedagogy?

Also, I was interested in finding out whether there was any particular pedagogical approach for neo-liberal education. Again, any suggestions are very appreciated!",7.566272586473929,10.661851677852354,8.520268456375838,54.3908002065049,65.7785234899329,13.175219411461024,40.99173980382034,12.09199376347754,6.832510170366545,736,44,100,32,13,248,95,149,0.031,0.88,0.08900000000000001,0.8663,2,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,3,2,2,7,2,0,0,5,0,10,0,0,3,2,16,16,6,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,6,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,1,13,1,22,14,6,15,0,0,1,0,10,8,0,0,5,71,18,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12383590903097608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4212214715573837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16236045167116336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16178845349537793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1022789632900558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5661314418510691,0.1317179048999789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10379471923787917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16162632717655448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08510317339195791,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13003754119873656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11482155672283212,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1676907369567367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1463861625925766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16695775311343022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21921153780548785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18626912385660596,0.0,0.0,0.38330989217754813,0.0,0.12291512430873618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09972027175706956

teaching,undsp2018,2018/02/28,"Quick Survey for U.S. Based Teachers and School Counselors Hello (U.S. Based) K-12 Teachers and School Counselors!

Are you willing to take an ANONYMOUS 10 minute survey about your experiences as a teacher OR school counselor?

We are interested in what school teachers and school counselors experience in terms of perceptions of support (including principal support), their personal relationship skills, their job satisfaction levels and their feelings of self-efficacy at work.

teaching,SG_51,2018/02/28,"Feeling nervous and maybe a little discouraged about teaching I'm in my education classes doing my field observations and I've been having to do my video teach lessons and lesson observation. I feel like I'm okay when planning and preparing but when i have to go up and do my lesson I feel like my nerves start kicking in and I don't explain things the way I intended to or can't add on once a student answers a question correctly. 

Most feedback I've gotten from my professor is just to speak louder. I'm naturally just a soft spoken/shy person so I feel like I struggle with this. My professors say I just need to find my teaching voice so I sound more confident. Explaining things better is something I've been told is a suggested area for growth. 

But one thing I feel discouraged and sort of embarrassed about is the cooperating teacher I was with last semester at my placement is friends with my professor for my science class. well this girl in my science class was talking to my professor and telling her how she got placed with the same cooperating teacher I had last semester is friends with my professor). And then I overheard my professor telling the girl in my class, ""oh yeah, my friend was telling me that she had an intern last semester and that sometimes she would forget she was even there and she had to do her video lesson and it was terrible"" And I know for a fact she was talking about me because it was the first time she ever had an intern in her class. I was just surprised and embarrassed because when I finished my lesson she told me I did pretty good. This was a high school biology class by the way, which I have no intention on teaching and it's not my focus area at all in my degree plan in college or anything. I even told my cooperating teacher beforehand like I haven't studied this since I was in high school so I don't remember a lot of this. But my lesson was just to teach them the vocab for the new unit and I did the best i could, I just felt like I couldn't build on anything or ask questions because I was just so unfamiliar and not confident with the content because I've only taken biology once in high school and like my second year of college. 

I love getting feedback because I want to improve but i also just feel so discouraged and feel like I'm gonna be such a weak teacher. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to improve or where to start to improve ",4.505705225007549,5.951919522198732,5.347379039565087,80.794955602537,70.4799154334038,8.365545152521896,31.696103896103892,8.841846274778883,2.6443137299909387,1926,86,366,35,35,628,195,473,0.069,0.745,0.18600000000000005,0.9963,0,0,1,0,0,0,22.0,0,0,1,11,29,26,0,4,21,2,42,2,0,4,4,88,72,40,0,5,19,0,9,7,3,2,1,4,0,3,14,26,0,3,22,2,0,2,8,9,1,3,27,13,68,17,46,40,6,43,0,3,0,1,35,24,0,10,22,258,82,27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08218750800092656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0672596181829512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05719503246090709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058808941033664935,0.0,0.13842430881418935,0.0,0.07862785047826155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2563514911002251,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08826416354044006,0.07438501108226687,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06715187747336376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07360181532833883,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11110257231311596,0.07607878306714806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2976860006276443,0.2403416600088535,0.08075504607760836,0.0,0.07687145214628707,0.07154060611946418,0.0,0.0,0.19494049383570666,0.0,0.043941966159836136,0.0,0.047799435139853325,0.07054420671227811,0.06726733180814927,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2665881387699931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04622251327011125,0.20567309219697752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2876299463866026,0.08429640816614889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07150399898226953,0.0759090394224243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08449588258025299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.062363607816033235,0.0,0.08123019596094155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17914050421211208,0.05699247038161856,0.06396647939609817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07343820283285228,0.08787297395125766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08556614089717626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18843616229012647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0952758163617868,0.0,0.0,0.06688454688908907,0.0,0.2553595917484496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06957343546185253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06474898521700177,0.08318308398167179,0.0,0.11906146165089017,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08792595763456648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1352025953984679,0.2205373168896589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16762906787262571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.049042943564746574,0.0,0.0,0.2411009499457895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04960795718867523,0.13351901551992693,0.0,0.0,0.07562148508588258,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05974656067310975,0.0,0.0,0.054161571195015135

teaching,hedgemonster1,2018/03/01,"Advice on becoming alternative high school teacher? I'm in college and had been planning on being a high school foreign language teacher. I've been reading more and more about alternative schools (the ones that do things differently than ""regular"" school at least) and I feel they would be a better fit. I feel called to work with students with behavioral issues/who are delayed in graduating due to pregnancy/whatever else, but I'm not sure how to go about this because there is very little information online and my college doesn't have any advice.


* How do you go about getting an alternative school job versus a more conventional high school job? 

* Do any schools have foreign languages or is it very basic ""english/math/science""?

I need some advice if anyone has any!
-How do sixth graders like to be talked to? This may sound silly but they want to be considered mature since they’re in middle school, but at the same time they are still kids! I have volunteered with a lot younger children and I’m afraid I’ll talk down to them just out of habit when working around kids.
- Any tips for keeping the class engaged?

This program was fun for me when I was their age and I know they’ll be happy to do something different in class. I just am nervous! Any advice is good advice.

teaching,anastaze,2018/03/01,"Digital Task cards : Boom Learning Just like many schools, they are trying to reduce paper and move more towards the digital. I have found a great ressource and platform that allows you to create digital task cards! It's called Boom Learning. 
Now I've purchased some that are already made, but I want to get into making some of my own and personalize them for some of my students that struggle more with learning a second language (I teach French). I have absolutely no intention on selling these. At least not in the near future/ I don't really see myself making these as a hobby, but just a tool for my students and I. 
Is there anyone that is familiar with this platform that would be willing to help a girl out? The tutorials the website offers are garbage and offer no solutions to the problems/things I want to create!

teaching,ilivefortennis,2018/03/01,"Share your interview strategies! Retirement and job posting season will soon be upon us, and I'm (still) looking for a teaching job. This will be my third year on the hunt. I currently work at a school, but not as a teacher. I'm certified to teach secondary social studies (6-12) in Michigan.

I have applied for countless jobs here in the Midwest, and have been interviewed 8-10 times. I have found that I am ""always a bridesmaid, never the bride."" I've been told I'm ""a great candidate,"" but never ""the chosen one."" I seem to interview well (as I've been asked to return for second-round interviews), my resume has been reviewed extensively, and my references and letters of recommendation are glowing. What am I missing? How do I lock down a teaching job? If you've been on an interview panel, what qualities do you look for in a candidate? What seems to set someone apart from the rest? If you've been hired recently, what tips do you have for the interview? How did you set yourself apart?

There won't be any movement in the social studies department where I currently work for a long while, and there's little hope for any other schools in the district.

All advice and/or encouragement is appreciated.

teaching,thischicksouttaideas,2018/03/01,"[RF]Behind Her: A Teacher’s Look at a School Shooting 
Behind Her

“If I don’t do it, nobody else will,” she thought to herself as she threw the covers off and rolled out of bed. 

The persistent beeping of the alarm on her phone reminded her that she needed to leave in promptly 45 minutes. Hurriedly, she showered as her husband woke their daughter and got their morning started. As she hopped out, her husband came into the bathroom wiping sleep from his eyes. 

“Morning,” he yawned.

“Good morning. How did you sleep?”

“Meh, I think we need new pillows. Ours are turning colors and poking me.”

“Yeah, I think they’re growing things. That’s what I get for buying the cheap ones,” she leaned in for a quick kiss after braiding her hair and throwing on some clothes.

“Why are you in such a hurry this morning?”

“I have students coming in for tutorials and about 89 essays left to read before grades are due at 4 today,” she replied as she stepped into her shoes. 

“Ah, well don’t work too hard,” he smiled as he smacked her butt in a loving, playful way.

“Mmmhmm,” she muttered as she checked the time on her phone, “I’ll be home early though.”

“Mama!!!!!” A scream penetrated her ears and she dropped the papers she had been gathering.

Her eyes widened and she bolted toward the door.

“ANNA,” she yelled, “Are you okay??”

Her four year old sulked toward her, shoulders slumped, visibly sobbing clutching something in her hand.

“What is it baby?” she persisted.

“H..h...e...he...he’s d...de..de...dead,” she finally muttered through the sobs.

“Oh, who is dead, love?”

“P...ph...ph...Phil…” she thrust out her hands and opened her fingers to reveal the lifeless goldfish to her mother.

“Oh baby, what happened?”

“I...I...I...wanted to let him sleep in a real b..b..be..bed…” she broke off into uncontrollable sobs.

“Wait, you wanted Phil to sleep with you?” her face contorted as she restrained a smile while simultaneously forcing a cough so as not to give way to the fit of laughter that was bubbling so close to the surface.

“Anna, fish sleep in water. They cannot breathe like people. He can’t be out of his tank.”

“But he doesn’t have a bed, mama. He can’t sleep without a bed. Did I kill him, mama? Did I kill Phil?”

“Oh baby…” her voice trailed off. There was not enough time to talk through the never-ending cycle of questions about life that followed the sudden death of a family pet. Her students were expecting her. “We will discuss this after school today, okay? You have to get ready for your class party. Let’s put him somewhere safe, so we can have a funeral this afternoon. We will talk all about Phil’s life and how these things happen tonight. How does that sound?”

“Can we get a new Phil?”

Closing her eyes and admiring her daughter’s ability to bounce back from tragedy so quickly, she smiled and sighed, “Of course, my love, of course.” She brushed her daughter’s cheek lovingly with her fingertips. “I have to get to work, little bit. I’ll see you at your party, alright?”

“Okay, mama, don’t forget to bring the cupcakes. You promised sprinkles,” She sniffled and wiped her eyes, “If you don’t bring them, nobody else will.”

“Of course!” She replied as she entered an alarm into her phone to remind her to leave work early enough to pick up the cupcakes. “1:45 should do it,” she thought to herself.

She kissed her daughter’s cheek swiftly and squeezed her gently.

“Will, I’m leaving!”

“Bye babe! See you this evening. You’re getting Anna, right? I have a meeting Downtown after lunch.” 

“Yes! See you this evening. By the way, there was an accident. Phil is in a plastic baggie on the table, can you...uh...put him in the fridge or something until I get home.”

The curiosity in his voice was evident as he choked out, “Uh…”
“Just don’t ask questions!” She shouted back as she choked back the giggles again.

“Yes ma’am! Love you!”

“I love you more!” She shouted as she headed out to the garage.

    The bell to release students from second period to third period rang, and she bolted out the door. 

“Gotta pee, gotta get coffee. Gotta pee, gotta get coffee. Gotta pee, gotta get coffee.” She chanted as she darted toward the faculty bathroom. One turn of the handle and she realized that the bathroom break was pointless during this passing period. “Gotta get the coffee, gotta get the coffee, gotta get the coffee.” She threw the door open to the teacher’s lounge, nearly knocking a student teacher over. “SO SORRY LESLIE!!”

“It’s okay, Julie! Are you okay?”

“Yes! You know how it is, the bathroom is oc…”

“Occupied? Oh my gosh! All day long. I know it! I just put a new pot of coffee on.”

“Child, I could hug you right now, but your hands are full, so I won’t! Are you all testing again?”

“Ugh. Yes, Mr. Mathers got the post-assessment results and was not happy, so we redid the entire Pre-Algebra Unit.”

“I am just not a numbers person! I don’t know how you all do it. You’re probably stuck with a class full of writers!”

“We flew through the lesson. They’ll get it; it’s just going to take another round.”

“Ahh, good luck, and God Bless you for the coffee!”

“Happy Tuesday!”

She reached the coffee pot and smiled a thankful smile. 

As she poured the coffee, she created a mental checklist of the things left to do today. There weren’t quite as many papers to grade, but still plenty to keep her busy. She had one parent conference over lunch, and then her sub would show up at 1:30 to review the rest of the day’s lesson. She hated to leave her students, especially amidst all the projects and research papers that they were working on, but they’d begun running like a well-oiled machine the last couple of weeks. No matter how many years she had been doing this, there was nothing, short of Anna’s accomplishments, that made her glow with pride like the moment that her students found the road to their success.

Each students’ success story looked differently, but there was no denying when they took their first step down that path. It was rare that an entire class would start on their journeys to success at the same time, but as the year drew to a close, more and more students found their way.  It was that time of the year that she could finally spend less time reviewing expectations and more time helping them find out how to take their work to the next level. She spent less time chasing down missing papers and more time filling out recommendations for Honors’ programs or community achievement awards. She was making less phone calls home to talk about concerns and more calls home to praise her students. It was past Christmas, but THIS was the most wonderful time of the year.

After stopping back by the restroom one last time, she headed back to the room taking the route that passed the faculty bathroom one last time. Singing silent praises as the door opened with ease, she rushed to take care of business and get back to the classroom. 

Half-way through fifth period things changed. 

The day was flying by, and she had not realized how late it was. The substitute had emailed and said he would be late. She sent a quick text to the room mom asking if she could pick up cupcakes for Anna’s party stressing the importance of rainbow sprinkles with the added promise of girls’ night and wine, and then dove back into class. After finishing their warm-up, her never quiet room was filled with extra excitement on this day. Her students had collaborated with the advanced art class to do a cross-curricular project. It was the culmination of weeks of hard-work, and the positive energy passing from student to student moved quickly through the room.

Until it didn’t.

A violent burst of sequential pops erupted in the distance. For a moment there was silence. Not the silence of a house with a toddler sleeping. Not the silence of a theater in the moment between the end of an amazing movie and the start of the credits. Not the silence that takes hold of the room when guests wait for “I do,” from the bride and groom.

This silence was life-changing. This silence was life-threatening.This silence was life-ending.

In that silence, 28 pairs of eyes that had not lived a full life looked at her. 

Seconds passed. Three more bursts. Louder. 

She looked at her students and to the ones closest to the window she said in a firm but pleading voice, “You three, close the blinds.” Her voice wavered but did not falter as she scanned the room for items to use as a barricade she glanced at the clock.

The red dots blinked angrily on the black pixelated background. 

1:40.

“Anna…” her heart ached. Her heart stopped. Her heart broke.

Seconds passed. One more burst.

The sound was getting louder. 

The sound was getting...closer.

Turning on her heels as calmly as possible, she uttered,  “We are in lockdown mode, as soon as I close the curtain, shove all the desks in front of the door.”

“Breathe in, breathe out,” she told herself as she rushed to the already locked door to pull closed the makeshift curtain she’d crafted in August. She reached the window, grasping the cloth desperately she hesitated as she saw two panicked students frantically moving through the hall. Throwing the door open, she grabbed them, threw them inside the classroom and slammed the door shut.

Seconds passed. Three more bursts.

“Why haven’t they made an announcement?” she thought. 

“Flip those two tables over on their sides and everyone behind them,” unsure of how the words were making their way from her brain out her mouth, she continued to stay in motion. It was not fight or flight. She had no fight in her. It was sheer survival mode. 

The two long tables joined perpendicularly in the corner of the room creating an impromptu fort; desks, bookshelves, chairs, and a toppled filing cabinet created a bumpy terrain in front of the door in effort to slow down any intruder. Books littered the floor, and art projects and poems were scattered across the room. In the blink of an eye, prized possessions and priorities turned into trash and debris covering what was now a battlefield.

Seconds passed. Two more bursts. 

This time there was a faint pinging sound that accompanied the shots. The ping of a used shell ejecting and hitting a locker clattering as it hit the tile. For the first time, she heard screams. Blood-curdling, heart-wrenching screams. The wall behind them shuddered creating an instinctive and collective gasp from them all. 

Seconds passed. One more burst.

Her children huddled together, the tears flowing, the muffled sobs as friends embraced. Students texted their families asking questions, but so many messages hung in that place between sent and delivered making the moments feel like days.

She sat closest to the door holding a student’s hand who sat praying in an undertone slightly behind her. The peach fuzz just making its appearance on his face. 

Behind her sat a girl who had spent the previous day hanging posters, hoping for votes for Student Council President. 

Behind her sat a girl who’d just competed in the One Act play with the school. They got third and on Friday the were to perform for the school.

Behind her sat a boy that had just moved to the area. His parents divorced suddenly, and he’d just started actively participating in class discussions.

Behind her sat a boy that was obsessed with science and had read every book on Space that he could get ahold of and that stood up for people that couldn’t stand up for themselves.

Behind her sat a girl, the cheerleading captain, who ran a welcoming committee for new students.  Her laugh could light up a room and her green eyes actually twinkled.

Behind her sat a girl that possessed a quiet fortitude. She was generous and kind with an amazing sense of humor that she reserved for only a select group of people.

Behind her sat a girl that had gotten in a fight with her mom before she left for school that day. The girl came to her that morning in tears because she couldn’t seem to figure out how to just communicate with her mom even though they tried so hard.

Behind her sat a group of children that had not lived their lives.

Behind her sat a group of children that had not seen the world.

Behind her sat a group of children that had so much still to contribute to the world.

Behind her were future doctors, explorers, engineers, researchers, writers, artists, entertainers, rescue workers, counselors, and teachers.

Seconds passed. One more burst.

The sound reverberated through her core as she heard the glass shatter and the handle turn from the inside. He stepped inside, and it was immediately evident that their minefield of furniture was no more disarming than a toddler’s jungle gym.

A second passed. One more burst as he shot in a spray around the room. The sobs were no longer muffled. The screams were not reserved, and the tears were flowing hysterically. Instantly she realized that the hope she had invested in their table fortress was not enough to protect them from the insanity that stepped into their school that day. Help was not coming fast enough. She was the only help they had.

As she stood, ready to take action, she could not help but look at the clock.

1:45.

“If I don’t do it, nobody else will,” she thought as she shoved the closest desk toward him. 

She heard an eruption of shots.

teaching,Xyphen,2018/03/02,"What can I teach with an MBA? Hello, /r/Teaching! 

What I would like to know is what type of teaching positions could I potentially get hired for immediately after completing my MBA? I plan to dual-concentrate in leadership and finance. This was based on a recommendation from an MBA coordinator who told me that when she completed the same program (with a leadership concentration) she was able to secure a position as an adjunct professor at the same school upon graduating.

I would be perfectly fine teaching at a community college level if I must. I've spent too much of my life doing work that I didn't much care for and I believe that teaching can finally be the career that gives my life purpose.",7.298081395348837,8.1627419379845,8.170067829457366,65.20765988372095,63.72868217054264,11.721317829457364,37.05523255813954,11.45678717892309,4.7029604651162815,566,27,94,17,8,191,86,129,0.022,0.884,0.095,0.8370000000000001,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.0,0,0,0,3,2,5,0,0,10,0,13,2,0,0,2,13,19,5,0,5,1,0,0,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,9,4,0,1,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,5,0,14,5,17,8,4,9,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,1,4,72,23,14,0.22405237416578694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25243030096016184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2284363277699944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4698293030760475,0.0,0.0,0.17888758946376646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24543842430509075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11705811808090508,0.21493145317336926,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12313332536572735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.316509635778387,0.10946067269484136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3294085496168713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22675296424115216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2140916450689672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16311279684359029,0.0,0.0,0.3183207564614319,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,madism,2018/03/03,Emergency credential? Can someone explain this to me a bit further? I've been subbing in my local district and some teachers who have liked what I've done for them have recommended the emergency credential because the district is always short of teachers. Anyone know how it works?

teaching,scootcat,2018/03/03,"Elementary to high school Has anyone ever made the switch from elementary to high school? 

I’ve recently become a coach for the high school level and I love it. Working with this age group motivates me more than my current position which is kindergarten (I’ve done this for six years). I’m not sure if it’s because it’s new or that it’s my true calling. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else has made this huge leap from elementary to high school and how it went. Thank you!

teaching,kimimonster,2018/03/03,"anxiety is getting the best of me Hi all,
This is my tenure year, and I've had a few ups and downs, so I'm really worried I'm not going to be re-hired for next year. I love the job (I get to teach, coach, and have a great relationship with my students) and the location (close to other family and my SO), but I'm worried that I should start the hunt for another job.  

There have been some instances this year where my questions were perceived as disrespect, and while admin did ""address"" them with me--it was basically a ""[Admin] thought you were disrespectful--I'd apologize,"" and I did, and that was that--my anxiety and obsessive nature is telling me that's grounds for firing. Is that true? Would that one instance be enough to override all of the other things I've done for the school and community?

I'd appreciate any stories about being non-renewed and having some good luck starting over or any other type of feedback... I'm a mess right now tbh.

How hard is it?",5.743764705882352,5.7706476117647085,6.449411764705888,79.1023529411765,67.0,10.094117647058825,31.117647058823533,9.888512548439397,2.7375176470588243,337,12,69,7,5,111,58,85,0.017,0.884,0.099,0.6747,1,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,1,0,0,2,5,3,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,2,1,15,16,6,0,5,1,0,1,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,4,5,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,10,3,11,11,1,5,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,1,3,47,14,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16116078443010864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1657083606861744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2041452135261651,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20739084818078546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23182091474224645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2476341539122598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21229577604841887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23771949306148554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2315619071435891,0.0,0.2092658076822264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15819213294369894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2671697175766632,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2398457252155085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1892598832762065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22335951873761026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18814295486230576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2850688309392139,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27956474366778783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.336700659857506,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,Jamazurunner,2018/03/03,"Burned out... alternative career ideas? Just another ""teacher feeling burned out and ready to leave, what should I do"" post! 

I've taught for almost 8 years and truly love what I do. My kids are fantastic and make teaching such a joy. But... its all of the other administrative stuff that is just killing me. This is heartbreaking for me to admit it... From unrealistic and unhealthy workloads (teaching 7 back to back 30 minute classes without going to the bathroom) to a lack of consistency with behavior plans (10 year olds throwing chairs at colleagues with minimum punishment), it's becoming a negative impact on my health.

 I just don't know if this is what I want to do for 20-30 years if this is what I am expected to experience.

I've tried many semi successful solutions but I'm at the point where I think this particular school, perhaps even the profession is not a healthy path for me.

So, what other careers would be a good fit for someone with a MA in Education? Curious to hear your thoughts and suggestions. Where's a good place to start?

Thanks in advance, I appreciate any of your thoughts!",6.081008403361344,7.417468333333335,6.404621848739499,75.09794117647061,66.64705882352942,10.142296918767508,34.669467787114854,10.290406445055957,3.722176190476192,876,41,158,22,14,282,129,204,0.07,0.7390000000000001,0.191,0.9749,0,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,2,0,3,10,9,2,0,11,0,14,2,0,1,1,34,29,10,1,7,9,1,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,1,16,10,0,0,7,0,0,3,4,3,0,0,3,2,14,6,29,23,2,23,0,1,0,1,8,12,0,3,7,107,30,8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1649421945476867,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11201450710265824,0.17272213901089672,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2533173482589819,0.0,0.0,0.18191909454478328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10879528640880984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1611267008457722,0.0,0.0,0.0832868300343557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0936135523768743,0.27631681297584304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17508849849291575,0.18565018272804445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18594759948728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18223706853498026,0.0,0.09052520504357583,0.0,0.0,0.17441354192426073,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1486652471322727,0.0,0.1099511513416048,0.16699912086196664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17284478711129656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1720962020875256,0.0,0.1557126115991285,0.0,0.15775518305727346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16670433062049275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13956579772372898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1165888921460278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1885637430444815,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1516510414421734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10554522632910904,0.0,0.2615368301694813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11183332730757173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971554807081772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15878315102014567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11701158749147972,0.0,0.0,0.31822073213063795

For xmas i got him snap circuits and not the junior one, didn't realize i purchased the regular one. He LOVES it (admittedly, so do i...)

I want to know if there are cool elementary ways whether it be a computer game, or pencil and paper type thing, any abstracted ways of learning those kinds of concepts.

teaching,HellBentEspeon,2018/03/04,"PGDE (Scotland) - Ordinary degree vs. Honours I am at an impasse so I turn to you:

Do I stand a chance of getting into a good PGDE without an honours degree? 

Some background: Currently I am an undergrad at a Scottish university deciding whether or not to leave university with an ordinary degree (Bsc) or stay on and complete my full honours. I'm going to apply to PGDE programmes after graduating with the hope of becoming a chemistry teacher. 

Reasons to leave: I have been teaching english language in different countries for years and I have completed a classroom assistant initiative in a Scottish school. And as a result of this I have a lot of experience and a collection of glowing references. I love to teach and want to get into the thick of it asap. 

Being in university is difficult for my partner who is unable to build his career without knowing which city we need to be in or what kind of support I can offer financially/ domestically. They have been so supportive and I want to do what is best for them. 

Another reason is that I genuinely want to leave the current course that I am studying. I am not as young as my contemporaries and that can be quite isolating. I am of an age where staying out till 6am and rocking up to classes still drunk just really isn't for me. 

What I am studying is really valuable and interesting. But I feel like the course is less an education in the subject matter and more of a job training programme for a specific field of work/ research. Which is valid, just not for me. the very strict composition of the course leaves no room for any academic freedom or exploration and that doesn't gel with the type of person that I am. 

Also less debt.

Reasons to stay: There are already multiple PGDE programmes that have explicitly stated that they want upper second class honours for entry. So I'm already dramatically decreasing my chances of getting into one. 
If I ever wanted to leave education i'd find that I have less opportunity in the field that my degree is in. 

I am lucky enough to be in a university that has a dissertation option focussed in science communication( particularly to younger audiences) which is ideal when you want to communicate science to younger audiences.

teaching,juggling_giraffe,2018/03/04,"Horrible school. I need help!! I started working at a charter school 2 months ago and I'm already burnt out! I 'teach' 7/8th grade and am experiencing many challenges:

* As a new teacher, I have no idea how to assess student's levels in reading, writing, and math. I can rank them against each other, but I don't understand how to apply this to the curriculum standards. 

* Right now, my organization is off. When I started the job they didn't tell me I was going to be the permanent teacher. As a result, I have no time at all to plan for anything- Right now, I make worksheets for them in class and as they are working on those worksheets, I make another for when they are done. This means that I have papers everywhere and am not creating activities. 

* If I do the grades accurately, everyone fails due to missing work, or due to not recording grades on my end. At this point, I can't keep up.

* All the students are at different levels. (one is esl and may have dyslexia (???)- there are no services in the school for specialty help)

* There are no science or social studies books for my grade. (When I arrived, the kids were studying from a 5th grade social studies book)
(there aren't many books at all as the school doesn't have a library, so I've been collecting and bringing in books for the past few weeks)

* We were introduced an online curriculum guide last week, which outlines what they should be doing and when, along with sample exercises. The only problem is the online guide does not line up with the curriculum in the classroom. So the topics I have been focusing on, were supposed to be done months ago. It's just so confusing to figure this out, especially with no textbooks for reference and having no record of what the students already know. 
* At this point, the principal stopped talking to me (mm pretty sure because I'm not always punctual) and the other teachers are unqualified and also in over their heads. I have no mentors. 

Positives/What I have accomplished:
*  Classroom management is under control

* The kids are more interested in reading since I arrived

* The lowest performing student has made huge strides forward as I've been giving him heavy guidance.

* They are doing their homework more often than when I first started

* I've learned patience in the context of teaching academia (wow)

* I've figured out how to better connect with students, understanding what they like to talk about and how to transfer that into the classroom.

teaching,GirlintheYellowOlds,2018/03/04,"Go back to a city school? Am I crazy? I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text. I just need some people with more life experience and different perspectives to give me their advice.

I am a young teacher, this is my 5th year in my own classroom. I'm having a hard time finding where I'm happiest teaching. I taught in an inner-city, very low income, Catholic school. 30 second graders, low resources, no breaks during the day, and all those trials and troubles. I was also in grad school, taking 1-2 classes at a time, while teaching. At the end of last school year, I decided that I was done. I couldn't do it anymore. 

So this year I took a long-term sub position in a public school in a ""good school district.""  15 first graders, every resource you could want, union mandated breaks, the works. This is the school that everyone gave me envious looks when I said I was teaching there. When I started, I was happy. Now, I'm bored, and I've been entertaining the idea of returning to teach in the city (not the same school as before) when this placement is up.

teaching,zingamaroo,2018/03/05,"Has anyone failed a student teaching placement? Or got certified through alternative pathways? Help I’m in my final semester of grad school in NYS. My last day of my first placement was supposed to be today. I was given an Unsatisfactory grade with 4 days left. I failed for a number of reasons - illness and personal - and bc of this I was not getting work done, revised, or turned in on time. 



I lost a lot of confidence in myself as a teacher and opted not to do the 2nd placement at this time.



My professor will email this week with my options to graduate. 



Is it common to fail? I was a straight A student. I had teaching experience. But issues I struggle with - disorganization, procrastinating, difficulty planning long term, etc - made things nearly impossible. 


My school says I can seek certification later on through alternative means, but I’m not really sure what that means, or if it’s not as “good” as the usual pathway. I wouldn’t mind doing Americorp or something


Any help would be appreciated. I don’t disagree with my coteacher’s assessment. I know I fucked up big time and I’m trying to accept that. I’m just trying to figure out where to go from here.

teaching,thriftthreads,2018/03/05,"Transition to adult education Hello! I'm currently a secondary ELA teacher and I'm looking to transition into adult ed (preferably post-secondary institutions, as opposed to community organizations). I've just finished my certificate in adult education, but I'm wondering if I should also complete my TESOL to be able to meet college/university hiring requirements. I don't know anyone who has made the jump from public school to college, so I'm a little hesitant to pay for another certification program. 

A) Would my adult ed teaching experience/practicum be enough?

B) Would anyone recommend Oxford Seminars for their certification? Is it reputable?

teaching,KimoTheKat,2018/03/06,"Substitute recommendations My career path towards teaching has reached a new milestone today (well technically tomorrow) as I begin my first assignment as a Substitute Teacher.

My career path is a long one with many stops along the way to gather expirence and hone in on what/who/where I want to teach. Presently I work for an After School Enrichment program that covers K-5 and I have five and a half years of ASE classes and summer camps so I have a pretty good handle on Elementary school aged children, but I'm looking for advice on middle school and even high school. I plan to substitute for the next two or three years as I get my bachelor's and teaching certificate.

teaching,atlas1331,2018/03/06,"So many doubts Where to begin... I’ve been passionate about teaching since I started seven years ago. Made some really amazing connections to my students and have had the opportunity to see them become amazing adults. I know I’ve helped them as much as they’ve helped and inspired me. I’ve never doubted my love of teaching, or if this was the right career for me, until this year. I made the leap from urban to suburban teaching this year, and from the beginning, things felt off. I’ve connected with the majority of students, though in a much different capacity than usual ( which I’m fine with). However, this year I’m faced with something I’ve never quite dealt with, and it honestly eats me up inside. I’ve spent so much time crying, and miserable. I have a class that is just terrible. They aren’t overtly bad, but wow are they the most entitled bratty kids I have ever worked with. They are the only class that I’ve yelled at, the only class I’ve had to do write ups for. And even though I try to explain the issue, they seem to be incapable of seeing that they cause so many problems. They want to believe they are innocent all the time. It’s frustrating to say the least, so much so that I’ve been contemplating quitting after this year. I don’t know what to do, and want to make this better, but how? I feel like I’ve tried everything at this point.

teaching,lovelypenguin23,2018/03/06,"Unsupportive parents Im a first year teacher, and I’m slowly starting to realize that my parents are not very supportive of me. They can be condescending and often act like what I’m doing is not truly difficult or considered work (compared to my brother, the engineer). They just don’t care about my work. Does anyone else come from unsupportive families? What helps??

teaching,morph1750,2018/03/07,"Is this too much? Hi all,
I like to think that I am a good teacher. I will smile and nod at most circumstances thrown my way. I should be happier that I have a small class (11 students) but I feel like it is too much. 2 students are pre-kindergarten. 3 are kindergarten. 2 are grade 1. 2 are grade 2. 1 is grade 3. Now they are giving me a 4 year old who does not speak ANY English. I've taught classes of 30 that felt better than this. I am using rotations to teach each grade/ability level but then that leaves me 10-15 minutes of literacy with them each day while then asking them to do independent work. Is it not bad to ask Kindergarten students to do 45 minutes of independent work in a non-play-based classroom? I just feel like I am stretched thin as well as under-serving these students. I would appreciate any comments. Don't care about votes or anything.

teaching,Cognitive_Spoon,2018/03/07,"Voice, Choice, and Defiant Kids: Open Discussion So I've been working on my own thoughts on the subject for a few years now, but I'd like to hear some fellow Redditeachers thoughts on the subject.  
If you wouldn't mind participating in a short discussion, I have three questions.  
1. What does your classroom diversity look like? (income, race, gender, etc)  
2. How much choice do you give students in your room? (assignment choice, timing, what kinds of control do you give to kids, if any?)  
3. Do you think student choice in the classroom is more important than whole class cohesive presentation of content, or is there some third path?

teaching,CupsOfSalmon,2018/03/08,"How to deal with a parent who thinks you are a racist I’m a first year music teacher at an elementary school in a very diverse community. Most teachers in my building are white, there are a few Hispanic teachers. I myself am white.

I have a student who is a fourth grader, and is African American. His behavior and respect for adults is atrocious. His classroom teacher (white) also has trouble with him. He is constantly harassing classmates with threats of violence, actual violence, and with rude name-calling behavior. He has had several office referrals from me and his classroom teacher. 

I have not personally had contact with his mother, but his teacher has, and his mother completely blames our issues with him on us being “racist.” Every problem this student has with us is apparently because he is black.  

Is there any reasoning with a parent like this? I will be sitting in on his parent-teacher conference two weeks from now. I’d like to support the classroom teacher as much as I can.

teaching,TheRail-Splitter,2018/03/08,"Problems with student... In order to understand my dilemma, you need a little bit of background. I am student teaching at an early college high school in a 11th grade American History II classroom. For the most part, the students seem to enjoy me being in the room. My CT is an older guy and a fantastic teacher, but they seem to connect with me more. However, there is one student (let's say just for the sake of this post that her name is Susie) who honestly has the biggest attitude I have ever seen in a person and refuses to respect anyone in a position of authority (Ironically, she asked one of the english teachers at lunch the other day if she could write a letter to her military recruiter saying that she does have respect for authority and has grown out of her rebellious stage.) I could tell from the very beginning that we were going to class just from a personality standpoint, but I wasn't going to let that get in my way of improving my instruction during my student teaching. She repeatedly calls me by my first name and is extremely rude to me when I try to answer her questions. She has also told me multiple times that she doesn't have to listen to a word I say because I am not her real teacher. Today I finally reached my tipping point with her and came close to losing it in the hallway. Here is what happened:

I am walking down the hallway returning to my desk to pick up my computer to take to the other history teachers room because I have to push into her class for a period (My CT only teaches two periods a day). She is walking down the hall with 2 other people and I am walking towards her on the right side of the hall almost brushing against the wall. Even though she was the on the right side of the hall as well, we could have easily passed by each other without a problem and gone on our way. However, she makes an effort to to step in my way and I have to stop because of that. We now are just standing looking at each other face to face in the hallway and her friends have kept on walking. This is the conversation that ensues:

Me: Excuse me
Susie: Are you gonna move?
Me: Well I believe I was here first and I have the right of way.
Susie: So? You need to move.
Me: You know, I find it very ironic that you asked another teacher yesterday to write you a letter stating that you respected authority.
Susie: You aren't an authority so I don't have to respect you. 
Me: Well I do have a staff tag and you don't.
Susie: That means nothing. 
Me: Whatever. I have places to be. (I then proceed to walk around her)
Susie: That is what I thought. (She proceeds on.)

I'm sure I didn't handle that situation properly but I was just so ticked at her I didn't know what to do. Maybe I am just overreacting and should let it go. Any suggestions on how to handle this student in the future? I am honestly open to anything.

teaching,queenofhyrule,2018/03/08,"Student teaching abroad? Hey all! 

I'm currently in my third year of college studying Middle Childhood Education with concentrations in ELA and Social Studies. Last week I found out that I was one of a few that was accepted into my school's student teaching abroad program!! It's a placement in an international school in Differdange, Luxembourg. The way the program is set up is that I'd spend the first eight weeks of my fall semester student teaching in a local school and working on/completing the EdTPA. Then, I would head over to Lux and student teach there for the second eight weeks of my semester. I was super excited, and I still am, but I'm starting to worry about how this may look when applying for jobs. I'm unsure if it'd be a help or a hinder, since I wouldn't have as much experience working in the school system that I would be hired to teach in. I know that it's an amazing experience, but as far as practicality, would this hurt me when looking for jobs? 

I also just would like any advice that you could have for someone who is preparing to student teach! I know that I still have awhile, but I need to study for and take my OAEs before I start student teaching in the fall, and I'm feeling very overwhelmed and I have no idea where to start. 

Honestly any advice whatsoever, related to the questions or not, would be amazing at this point!! Thanks for reading!

teaching,lobstertelephone,2018/03/09,"I am a monster/I made a kid cry My teaching persona is characterized by a great deal of tough love and sarcasm. I do, on occasion, probably toe the line between what is an acceptable amount of banter and what is not. I also recognize the importance of knowing which kids can take a little ribbing and which can’t. I’m sure I’m not alone here especially with my fellow high school teachers.

Anyway, I have a student who has been wearing a back brace for a few months and has been very open about how his doctor says he’ll have to wear it for a while and how it sucks, etc. Today he was talking during a test and I had fussed at him a few times about quieting down. Then, I see his body completely turned around in his desk in order to talk to a student behind him, so I say “Student! This is why your back messed up! Turn around and hush!”

I knew as soon as I said it that it was out of line. He turned around and I could immediately tell he was hurt. I quickly apologized saying that was out of line. Right after this, the test ended and we moved on to another activity but I could see him trying not to cry. I felt horrible but I didn’t want to call any more attention to it at that moment. I asked him to stay after class and  repeated how terrible it was for me to say that and that I couldn’t imagine what it was like to wear his brace every day and that he didn’t deserve to be talked to that way especially not by a teacher or an an adult. I told him I was very truly sorry. He wouldn’t make eye contact with me and just said “yes ma’am” and left.

I know I screwed up and I’m going to have to work very carefully to earn this kid’s trust back. 

What’s your immediate regret monster moment?

teaching,midori_kaminari,2018/03/09,"Age Group Preferences And Getting Hired I'm doing my junior practicum in a middle school classroom, and will start my student teaching in the fall. When my mentor teachers/professors/advisers ask me what grades I want to teach, I usually say, ""I gravitate towards middle school but I enjoy elementary school as well."" My question is, when I use these people as my references, will it affect my ability to get hired in an elementary school? Will it be difficult to be hired in an elementary school if I do my student teaching in an middle school? If so, I can accept that, I just want to know what I'm getting into.

It feels weird to say ""I prefer middle school"" when I coach 2-8 year olds on the weekend and love it. In fact, I grew up thinking I would be a fifth grade teacher. What did you guys say when asked the age preference question?",5.9865838509316776,6.53825539130435,6.446763975155282,77.5183447204969,66.51552795031057,9.42136645962733,32.87018633540373,9.3871,2.9563609937888207,662,27,122,12,10,215,90,161,0.033,0.843,0.124,0.9404,0,0,0,0,0,0,23.0,0,1,0,0,7,6,0,0,8,0,12,1,0,2,1,24,27,13,0,8,4,0,1,0,0,4,0,3,0,1,9,4,0,0,10,2,0,2,0,2,1,0,1,4,21,4,17,19,0,27,0,0,0,1,11,14,0,4,11,80,30,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21338550637178694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05770572349668539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17887895910204732,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11300305257282366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06272087014922427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1030035077699868,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11975643074389568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07912085745379699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25569531447481003,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27227361843603365,0.0,0.8085138794648107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08077923448627262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07312757184335501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09856854370882168,0.12569407662966975,0.0,0.1346293838682774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10261331569848076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08107210120623212,0.0,0.0,0.07349364267903502
teaching,Mijder,2018/03/10,"Being asked to reboot classroom management in March. In my third year, and never had an issue with classroom management before, but moved to a new school this year (so I could send my daughter to the best school in the district, yatta yatta yatta).

They fired the previous principal just before Christmas, which is fine because there was chaos all the time (fights, no enforcement of rules). I fully admit I got into survival mode in like...October, and have been there ever since.

Since the new admin came in, I've been observed three time and have gotten savaged. Had a meeting with the principal and she is putting me on an improvement plan, one of the instructions of which is basically ""restart classroom management at square one""...in March... in a year long class.

teaching,ElGringoMojado,2018/03/10,"Can a retiring engineer without a degree become a teacher? My situation:

I've been a software engineer since the mid 1970's. At that time, I finished about 3 years of college, and then life happened. No need to go into the details, but I never finished my degree. At that time, programmers were almost non-existent. I began writing software, and never needed a degree.

Fast forward over 45 years, and I'm tired of programming for the man, and would like to start a second career. For a long time, I've had a desire to give back what I've learned over the years. I enjoy teaching and working with young people. I've taught a few classes as an adjunct instructor at the community college.  I'd like to become a STEM teacher at the middle school or high school level. I wouldn't mind relocating to a more rural area.

Other hobbies and interests that lead to STEM topics are: I'm a private pilot, an extra-class amateur radio operator with significant electronics experience, and a scuba diver.

Without a degree, is there any hope of getting hired as a secondary teacher? Would I have to go back to school and get a bachelor's or master's degree? If so, the whole thing falls apart just due to the time involved.

Tips and Practices to Ensure a Cohesive Teaching Environment Where the Principal is the Highest Authority
The ultimate goal is to surround yourself with people that will lie for you and support your decisions. You must create an environment of fear, where everyone knows that they must cooperate or face the repercussions. Everyone is ultimately a tool to help you create and enforce this environment. Those that do not step in line must be targeted, harassed, bullied and driven out.
1.	Find a “friend” to promote along with you. Try to find a Lisa, they’re agreeable to being a mindless drone. Bring them along with you when you become principal so that they feel they owe their career to you.
a.	This will allow you to control you’re A.P. entirely. This is useful because you can coordinate lies and use your AP to corroborate stories that are serially untrue.
2.	Seek out the newly promoted and inexperienced.
a.	These people are likely to be easy to control and manipulate. 
3.	Seek out a newly promoted I.F., perhaps a Caitlin. Caitlins are timid and easy to control too.
a.	He/she will be easy to manipulate.
4.	Once you have an A.P. and an I.F. that you can manipulate you will have unfettered and unchecked control over your entire staff. There is NO oversight that this oligarchy will have to report to.
The next step is to use the unchecked power you now possess to force the teachers to do your bidding. Seek out all the teachers that you can, perhaps a Valerie. Valerie will prove to be a useful tool as she will spy on other teachers and even work with you to set the other teachers up so that you can “catch” any teacher you don’t like. Keep in mind, that once you have an A.P. and an I.F. on your side, you can bully the teachers all you want. Some teachers will inevitably fall in line and there are sure to be a few that you can use to help attack other teachers. What you must watch out for is teachers that have a good connection with their students, the parents and the community at large. These teachers are dangerous. The only threat to your power will be an active and connected community. If a teacher were to confide in the P.T.A. or to a large group of parents, the parents may be able to make your life difficult. Seek out those teachers, attack them, write them up, make them feel like they are crappy teachers and drive them out. Do whatever it takes. Lie, cover up, change policies in the handbook to make an excuse to write them up. As long as you have the support of your A.P. and I.F. you can do whatever you want.

teaching,Battlegun1,2018/03/11,"Is lessons.com a Good Site to Start Tutoring Piano? Hello everyone. I am Alec, and I am seeking to tutor beginning piano students, preferably children. I've researched a number of ways to acquire my first students and, since I don't really have a strong network right now, figured that using online teaching sites such as lessons.com would be a good option.
I'm wondering if any of you have experience using online teaching sites and maybe you can also share what other techniques you have used to gain students.

teaching,Skellyborg,2018/03/11,"When is the moment when you say enough is enough? I am currently a trainnee physics teacher in the UK doing a pgce and I am sat here on Sunday night nearly in tears at the thought of another week. 

I just don't think I am a strong enough person for this job, I don't think I have what it takes. I'm currently on placement in an ofsted 'outstanding' school and it is seriously hard work,  there is so much information to take in and I am so overwhelmed. I normally get to school for about 7 and i leave at about 6 and have about an hour at home before I just go to bed.

My friend is in her first year of teaching at a pretty rough elementary school. She has dealt with a lot of behavior issues and office referrals and had gotten very little to no support or guidance. Last week, she was told that it was decided she is not a good fit for the school and would not be getting get contact renewed for next year. 

She initially wanted to turn in a resignation now so that her leaving is on her terms, but her union reps have pushed that she let it go so that she can collect unemployment benefits. She is worried about having this termination on her record for future job interviews. When asked, ""Have you ever been fired or asked to resign,"" would she need to legally answer yes? How much would this affect her chances at getting a new job?

teaching,teachingistough,2018/03/11,"Adult students who don't do their work but pay for the course...what to do? I teach a class of adults (average age around 30) and they pay for the course as part of their training to be managers at their respective franchises.

You'd think being at that age AND paying for their education, they put in the work! But they don't.

They forget their books, their homework, they don't prepare what I give them to prepare, they come in late or don't come at all.

Normally, in any other class I'd give students detention or deduct points from their grade but their grades don't count until their final exam in a year and their presence doesn't count either.

So I have no leverage AT ALL.


I thought, since they're all adults, I may just bring in a piggy bank and they have to pay something like 50 cents for forgetting things and at the end of the course they get the money and can spend it on something like dinner for everybody or something. But I'm not sure that's allowed. Bringing in cakes or similar isn't something I want because they'd have to bring in a lot of cakes and that's not good from a health standpoint.

teaching,fucking_hilarious,2018/03/11,"At my wits end with our 8th Graders. Need serious advice. Substitute Teacher I am my building's substitute teacher.  I get to know the students fairly well but do not see all of them on a regular basis.  The majority of the kids like and enjoy me and the teachers trust me to follow their plans.  The administration enjoys me as well, well enough to rush me into my position at the beginning of this year from a floater.  Ninety percent of the kids are fine and if they aren't, they are normal middle school annoying.  You know... chatty, distracted, trying too hard to be funny, etc.

And then there are our eighth graders.  Never before have a met a group of students so downright disrespectful and rude.  Its to the point where most of the 8th grade teachers have just given up (considering the administration will let them graduate anyway regardless of grades or behavior).  I've asked for advice and was told to pick my battles wisely. Here are some of the highlights (and there is way way way more than this).


""I'm not listening to you.  If I don't do what you say then you'll get in trouble because you suck at your job.""


""I'm having an allergic reactions to cats, I need to leave."" This said while another student asked if I was going to punish them for breathing and another was throwing stuff.  The student in question, no allergies.


""What are you going to do about it?  Call my parents, they'll have you fired.""


""You don't know anything, if you did you would be a REAL teacher""


""Maybe if you didn't talk back to me then I wouldn't be so rude.  After all, you deserve it."" I asked him to stop talking during directions.


""We already got one sub fired, maybe we can get you fired too. We just have to tell the principal a couple things.""

I have one male student that always seems to find me alone.  I move to the hallway were there are others.  I've reported this.

""What gives you the right to tell us what to do.""

""This isn't your classroom and we don't have to listen.  If you try to make us, we'll just tell Ms. so and so it was you that broke stuff.""

Two students got into a fist fight last week so they could leave the room and not do work.

The teachers have given detentions.  They have called home.  They been given in school suspensions.  I've sent kids to the office, had the principal call home (he offered) and I legit but need some advice/coping mechanisms.   Because I think that I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  I've had it with them.  I love my job and I would never want to leave but I need some advice.  Note that I'm 25, I've never tried to be friends with them, I follow a strict set of rules for myself ( I never touch my phone, I dress professionally, I'm involved), I have a good relationship with the teachers (I'm an alumni of the school) and I'm certified to teach in two states K-12.",2.462795603191456,4.691225577132489,3.5411163236653778,88.1913601342328,78.16515426497276,6.481539567852619,23.28188884703627,7.5680677535414835,1.04704216005205,2187,71,440,32,53,704,247,551,0.117,0.802,0.081,-0.9526,3,1,0,0,1,0,90.0,9,18,12,2,21,24,7,2,34,0,52,3,1,2,6,72,96,34,0,17,16,1,5,1,1,7,1,4,3,4,22,24,0,1,7,0,0,8,15,12,3,4,19,10,72,12,59,64,11,47,0,1,1,1,74,18,1,13,17,305,94,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22571595994064605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07974363176456778,0.08496593145504745,0.0,0.064066033843773,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16147200692115726,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06336035021843574,0.0,0.2159398816249582,0.0,0.0,0.059204426319579964,0.0,0.0938709126700065,0.0,0.06551710053990213,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2358616060338411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061474267214858914,0.08519353747680505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06819474424546526,0.07955644922679579,0.08586981242762165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07037206357051652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05948617005685484,0.0,0.12068017773862882,0.0738606497234615,0.08751610108510251,0.06457977910760561,0.1231599200497411,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06897242452740937,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1544645880296538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1528113757372881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12694336654561647,0.06276122676112557,0.0,0.2445798622864528,0.0,0.07873263590371488,0.0,0.037615883041030335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06949102168183385,0.0,0.05139478115570567,0.0,0.15470371521195903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08183353305855326,0.0,0.2283633599305501,0.2375332584032465,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07543878291471501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10434765148194902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08549387032260941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07278519141156453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08625205600662927,0.0,0.0,0.08763720178381561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08266384884795154,0.0,0.0657533358915931,0.07323990628965434,0.06122953910909708,0.0,0.2337692462172514,0.061355071230582224,0.07009338460991246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06437129363422386,0.0,0.0,0.17628177948882942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12377137900522102,0.2018911527038173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.051152077445474314,0.04933530702521528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07357205179459471,0.0,0.15682371615272514,0.0,0.150425915197466,0.0,0.18523108460327936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04541366423313409,0.18334521566264406,0.061760769704061434,0.0,0.20768333915301096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056053299669270105,0.0,0.0,0.10939012203923562,0.0,0.0,0.049582275666672934
teaching,usuallyconfused91,2018/03/11,"2nd year charter teacher feeling hopeless about the future, any advice or motivation? I'm a second year teacher at a charter school. Literally my only experience as a classroom teacher has been at this school. I have always hated the school I work for but I am dedicated and work hard to achieve results. My first year ended on an extremely high note - I got the highest scores in the whole school, my principal was very happy with me, praised my management etc etc. I decided to stay another year because it was job security and I felt respected at the school. This year we have a new AP who is extremely critical, nitpicky, biased and unfair. She has made the life of pretty much every K-5 teacher hell with unfair low evaluations, making very demeaning, antagonizing comments, and criticizing everything we do but without advice/feedback on how to improve. She has weekly meetings set up with me during my prep but she literally never shows up to these meetings. She told me I need to print out all of my testing and AR data every week with these meetings, yet she never shows up to them. Then gives me low ratings for professionalism in my quarterly evaluation rubric. We've had ""data"" meetings with the principal which she has sat in on and told me ""just because your students are quiet doesn't mean they're engaged"". Then didn't offer ANY ways on how to get them more engaged. The principal just sat there silently watching it all, so I don't think explaining all of this to him will do anything. She told me I need to give way more homework so I did. Yesterday a kid peed in his pants, and the father called the school and he cursed me out about the pants peeing and about the homework. The kid's parents met with the AP because they were extremely pissed and wanted to transfer him... and afterwards she told me they said the kid hates life/school because of me (this kid does NOTHING ALL DAY, other than drawing and playing with pens - sure I've disciplined him but nothing extreme. The mom has always been very polite/nice to me and complained about the homework...I explained the situation to her and she left very positively). The AP, after meeting the parents. told me I need to watch my tone with kids and also got angry about the homework situation at me (another parent complained about more homework too - it was literally 5 pages). I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel depressed, anxious, stressed, helpless...I want to quit teaching for good. I've already told my principal I'm not coming back next year (my official excuse is I'm moving) and I am hardcore applying to any other school I can find but I'm so tired of feeling bullied, blamed for things that aren't my fault and micromanaged. What can I do to get through this feeling of hopelessness? Do you think the AP can affect my job prospects elsewhere?",5.507017467036442,7.202610872865279,5.846223908918407,77.2158818663942,68.35483870967742,8.365280007784753,33.247165863864154,8.841846274778883,2.9621424512236647,2258,104,389,39,39,722,248,527,0.158,0.745,0.096,-0.9927,5,0,0,0,0,2,68.0,2,2,4,7,19,22,4,1,28,0,34,4,2,7,7,74,75,32,0,5,11,5,6,0,0,1,2,2,4,5,18,30,0,2,14,3,0,2,9,13,0,3,23,10,62,9,63,51,12,50,2,5,2,0,58,21,2,1,23,260,80,25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06219312324877679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07023380156618662,0.05089685555706097,0.10591541882870392,0.0,0.0,0.12984227614075666,0.13347459032558825,0.0,0.0719006946886698,0.06311870341840563,0.0,0.0,0.05237438333457295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04893904955504702,0.0,0.1551895198557354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06498862525084377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.054824501881170176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04104573724136063,0.0,0.054817315138619566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0556961378120563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05637054820880595,0.0,0.14196191963735535,0.0,0.0,0.10724725608074843,0.0,0.057199990736879126,0.062256988331259214,0.0,0.0,0.12872322658823948,0.0,0.06110914731237167,0.0,0.05817034503093318,0.05413637475940833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0665037347802651,0.12210809973811085,0.0,0.05338237706993668,0.1018053852591181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06775124877019734,0.05701338754062564,0.12567245306026928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06724439992753023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12631561446798106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034977608332446834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06915044075065943,0.0,0.08990864204162252,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06022240480221345,0.042483508382852975,0.0,0.0,0.06932802510148382,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07454021385224102,0.0,0.06764452556299222,0.04678637239608445,0.14157580542886916,0.09817384127007234,0.06146870384321877,0.06768714236821614,0.0,0.0,0.12213812096143345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.048404863873315454,0.0,0.0,0.21201060544626332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06474981023491172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06769425454543007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060540936313929025,0.0,0.0,0.5152968197937365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14307921467384652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0678370645124003,0.0,0.0,0.07290509243212841,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.059984626353425975,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.042282886746252836,0.08156224746736468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07315052477364277,0.0,0.3648929493082234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21005504642839665,0.07507889874262981,0.1010368216565532,0.1021043039177397,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07105733058680244,0.0,0.061351475133372725,0.0,0.09266858513013196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2459116248645232
teaching,ThrowAwayMyMajor,2018/03/11,"I am considering changing my major to Elementary Education but how does it work? What I mean is how does it work when trying to focus on a particular subject that you want to work with? Do you choose any subject you want as a concentration? Or, is it more like you learn a little of everything and what you are hired as depends on the school?

I am looking at my college's major map and some courses pretty much say just pick any math, or science, or etc to fill your requirements. Then there are the later required courses that have teaching certain subjects. So I am kind of confused on how much of a choice I should have.

Then there are ""field experience required"" courses. So that means you have to start right away in getting experience at a school I guess.. So does the college give you a place to go to, or do you have to search on your own? Given these kinds of courses, how would I try to stand out among other students in the long run if everyone is required to get experience to even move on in the major.

teaching,SlimeQSlimeball,2018/03/13,"Anker Nebula Capsule Projector I've had it for about a week now and it is a great pico projector. If you've never heard of it, it's roughly the size of a soda can, has a built in battery and speaker, and runs Android built in but can also take HDMI in from a laptop or any other device. 

It is capable of displaying a picture of pretty much any size from a few inches to over 100"" and the built in speaker is quite good for even full volume listening. Tilting the Capsule up or down will automatically adjust the keystone to ensure the display stays square.

teaching,illusiondistortion,2018/03/14,"Online Resources in Genetics for Middle Schoolers? Hi everyone!

I'm a technology coordinator at a middle school, and the science department is looking for online resources they can use to enhance their unit on genetics. Right now, the students complete a number of Punnet Square worksheets and paper-based projects to learn about inheritance.

I'm hoping to find online programs that will help them better teach this context. Unfortunately, though, most of the tools I've found have been created by colleges/universities and have been more complex and rigorous than our middle school curriculum is. The tools will likely be too advanced for middle schoolers to use independently.

Does anyone have any resources they'd recommend? Thanks in advance!

teaching,mfs369,2018/03/14,"I’m having trouble with a colleague who told my kindergarten student to keep a secret from me! When my kindergartener students write, they use inventive spelling, which is what is developmentally appropriate and expected of them at grade level. 

I have the sped teacher come into my classroom every afternoon to help me out with our writing block, since every kid needs a lot of support when they are this young. 

Well, yesterday I had a kid come up and we sounded out boat. She spelled it b-o-t, whiling is perfect since buh-oh-tuh is how it sounds when you sound it out. 

It's not spelled right but that isn't important at this point in their development. 

Well, a few minutes later the kid comes back to me and shows me her page with boat spelled correctly, and I'm like ""wow, how'd you figure that out?!"" And she tells me ""oh, Mrs. (sped) told me but she said it's a secret"".

I. Am. Furious. 

First off, don't tell my kids to keep secrets from me. Second off, I've explained about inventive spelling and why we use it.  Additionally, this teacher has no educational background whatsoever. 

She has been teaching since the beginning of January. So 2 1/2 months. Which is fine, she’s being trained currently, but if you don’t know what you’re doing and the teacher whose classroom you are in tells you to do something a certain way, then do that! 

I don’t want my kids discouraged from trying to spell things on their own. It’s what they need to be doing now. They need to feel proud that they phonetically sounded a word out, not corrected behind my back and then told to hide it from me. 

I don’t know how to approach this teacher to talk about this. I am very non-confrontational. 

Advice? Anyone experienced something like this before? Anything is appreciated.

teaching,FroopOG,2018/03/14,"Online calendar for lesson ideas? Hi all, I'm on the look out for an online calendar that I can use for organising my lessons.

I currently use a paper teacher planner which is great for day to day, but it is a page per day so not the easiest for longer term planning (ie beyond a week).

I would like an online calendar I can set up with recurring lessons (and hopefully holidays etc) but one that I can also edit in a brief description of the lesson planned. Ideally, I'd be able to see that description (or at least part) on a week/month View without having to click on individual days.

Basically, I want an easy way to get an overview of the lessons I'm teaching each term - I teach several different subjects so have a lot to juggle.

I've tried Google calendar but I can't get it to display how I want it.

I am a first year history teacher abroad who with the help of some wonderful students started up a Pen Pal club at the beginning of this school year. For the most part it started off fine, however, just before Christmas the correspondence between my students and the school we were initially writing with completely halted. I have spent the past two months hoping maybe the lapse was brief and then, after it had gone on too long, trying to find other teachers/students to write with from my colleagues here to no avail.

The students participating in this club are wonderful, driven students who really want to make connections with people outside of their home country. While they have many international teachers, the interactions with international peers are at times not as consistent. I would like to help them with this in anyway that I can, and is part of the reason why I thought a pen pal club would be a great idea! However, in order to do that the students need someone to write with.

If you are interested here is a little more specific information about the club. The 15-20 students I work with in this club are grades 8-12 and have very strong English for non-native speakers. Because of this, all correspondence would need to be primarily in English and it would be preferable to correspond with other high school students. Additionally, we are a 1 to 1 school, therefore, the students prefer to use email or other forms of online communication as the basis for their correspondence. The most important thing we are looking for, however, is a group of students who are absolutely dedicated to this wonderful opportunity. If students aren’t 100% committed to the idea, it makes everything that much more difficult.

I am hoping that you and your students may be interested in this opportunity! I believe that this is a wonderful opportunity to build a more global community among students. It is through opportunities like these that we can start breaking down the barriers that often times divide our society and world. I am well aware that many of you and your students might not have the time to do such an activity, however, if you do and if you think that this is something you would be interested in, please PM me and I can provide you with a little more information about where I teach, the nature of the school itself, and how I hope the correspondence might go. It is almost 9:30 PM for me right now, so if you are in the US know that I may not respond until later tonight for you.

Thanks!",10.05090909090909,8.982341450216452,9.431601731601734,64.84597402597403,58.74025974025975,12.555844155844154,40.264069264069256,11.567385478589935,4.696178354978353,2058,89,346,48,22,659,218,462,0.01,0.825,0.16399999999999998,0.9969,5,0,1,0,0,0,50.0,6,11,4,8,14,18,0,0,34,0,46,0,0,6,2,83,73,24,0,18,10,0,0,2,3,9,0,1,1,0,34,26,0,2,15,5,1,4,5,1,1,2,7,3,38,17,65,52,12,48,0,0,2,0,39,22,0,22,22,266,72,25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.085544841265688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.052076748584923366,0.0,0.07269381911357088,0.09624927131476127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08957072089084972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08163110670187977,0.07677811077535368,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07808059297020108,0.07266589600291767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04855129095594536,0.0,0.0,0.0941858158843304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11452256668551028,0.09026046892922612,0.08569229047950076,0.2545509316266933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19287797067931256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0469495650717663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08347262546872107,0.1712446779942589,0.0,0.07560201025334301,0.14347775197909374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11404909234159495,0.173223271641583,0.08582495102149962,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1812534179624886,0.0,0.0,0.06818864301743095,0.0,0.0628001724533061,0.1266890982824275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18502264611032096,0.0815516831801087,0.0592257383662419,0.0,0.0,0.0937754297641399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05472802921926313,0.08783527915537456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07295593159691552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4322937360067042,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07238374659155983,0.06576744706658272,0.0,0.0,0.18140133819592572,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07865158035226917,0.0,0.0,0.056755256787348565,0.054739478017945264,0.0,0.06782111358264713,0.14944307701846155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058000709030060174,0.0,0.08345175671119742,0.0,0.10276061400306168,0.07378325979656072,0.0,0.07048790312654442,0.05038825994806187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07681096469410359,0.0,0.07708641907494093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37057658980886704,0.06219335705179835,0.0,0.0,0.303431687254254,0.0,0.0,0.11002699902316873

teaching,rainbowbowbow,2018/03/14,"Teachers working hours and mobility across countries Hi, I am considering teaching as a career and have the following questions

1. I enjoy one to one tutoring but I imagine teaching is a whole new kettle of fish. I am not confident at class management. Any advice?

2. Do teachers really mark assignments till midnight every day? 

3. Do teachers really not get summers off at all?

4. How easy is it for a teacher qualified in Asia to teach in say, the UK or the US?

5. How hard is it to get days off during term time?

Thanks!

teaching,ReignOfDiatribes,2018/03/14,"The Dehydrated Teacher: A Peeing Puzzle I am a high school teacher. My school has block scheduling, and drinking liquids tends to make me want to urinate immediately. I am sure this is not a problem unique to the teaching profession, but I tend to avoid liquids during the school day because I know I cannot run off to the bathroom whenever I feel like it. The consequence of this is that I feel fatigued and dehydrated from lack of liquids. Right now, my only solution is to drink as much as possible at the beginning of preps and at the very end of the day, but some days I have class for almost three hours straight.


Does anyone else have this problem and/or have some solution to stay hydrated?

teaching,majorfrickingbummer,2018/03/15,"Sudden Illness as Student Teacher Hi, first post here and I have a question for you all on how to redeem myself.  There's going to be some tmi as I tell the story.  I'm a Master's student getting dual certified in middle school and high school.  I had just finished the middle school and built a really good relationship with my CT there, but this is my first week at the high school and I'm already afraid I ruined my relationship with my CT because I had to call out sick last minute this morning.  I don't know if the fact I'm working 20 hours a week, student teaching, and going to class finally caught up to me, but I had been going strong all year.  What had happened was I had gone to bed at a decent hour, woke up, taken a shower, and as I was about to leave I felt some awful pain in my intestines and proceeded to be stuck on the toilet for about 5-10 minutes.  I texted him that I couldn't make it and sent my lesson plans, but he sent me, ""You need to detect these things earlier.  You are not calling out of work at a part time job, this is your profession.  Remember, your first year will be probationary.""  Any CTs here?  How bad is this if it doesn't happen again?  Do you think this is something he'll hold over my head for the next five weeks?  Is it better for a student teacher to go in and leave early if they're sick? I really respect the guy and like his teaching style, so I don't want him to close off on me.",4.519319727891158,4.587167326530611,5.349387755102043,85.80156462585032,69.61224489795919,8.029931972789115,26.877551020408163,7.594959193182576,1.289232653061224,1110,31,239,11,18,363,161,294,0.124,0.815,0.061,-0.9503,2,0,1,0,0,0,30.0,0,6,0,10,11,9,0,1,15,1,24,6,2,3,3,41,48,22,0,6,8,0,1,1,0,2,4,0,2,1,12,15,0,1,6,0,0,8,5,4,0,4,16,1,34,5,38,26,5,48,0,1,0,0,21,20,0,6,20,158,46,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11923646402229986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07347807628420935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902176923816527,0.06586660976723019,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09556192703344224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22066337586122206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10374546845621707,0.11836409134075895,0.0,0.27572321691350576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.056451950504223525,0.0,0.2456304605788177,0.09062767130618736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10698702792139958,0.19109748143271116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11089103246704007,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2283226678283717,0.0,0.0,0.2128160447707113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10722349413033408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0593817541485009,0.08807561605627279,0.0,0.2288198532492734,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05278803878307163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07212457827815913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08011811052991455,0.0,0.0,0.1149129811541582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11497339875019665,0.0,0.0,0.11700821153969873,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10348255484701116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12104133970831543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13843989273010718,0.0,0.0,0.232011698578703,0.12240020507824124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4374116831497422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08318258894864425,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09444093945867953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0717839813857636,0.06923442679203089,0.0,0.0,0.06300514211467012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06373101134446774,0.0,0.2600148907460861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15732416828460655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1391620177035508

teaching,SolomonCleft,2018/03/15,"I wrote a 3,000 word article with 7 examples of experiential learning activities Full disclaimer: I work for a company whose product is a free math video game for kids in grades 1-8. 

The point of our blog is to deliver awesome content to teachers, and I just finished my first post about experiential learning activities.

A few thoughts on the article:

This was a genuinely fascinating topic to research and explore. 

But writing this article gave me some deeper insights into *why* game-based learning is experiencing such an explosion in popularity: it's a form of experiential learning, which is one of the most strikingly effective (and, in my opinion, underused) pedagogical strategies.

Also, I've had some bad experiences with sharing original work on reddit, so I expect to be downvoted...but I'm new to writing education-themed content and any feedback would be great!

teaching,KCakes25,2018/03/16,"Advice on new jobs I’m a fifth year teacher. Each of my five years I’ve been in the same school but with a different admin. I’ve never had trouble with any of them before but this years admin is the worst. She told a family that an IEP doesn’t entitle the student to attend school because he’s in preschool. She purposely keeps the gross motor balls deflated so they don’t bounce too high and break the lights. I love my current district but just can’t work for someone who has no idea what they’re doing anymore. FWIW, I’m willing to take a small pay cut to be happy but many area districts pay close to $10K less than what I currently make and I can’t swing a pay cut that large. 

Anyway, I started looking for new jobs. One school called me for an interview even though I hadn’t even submitted their application yet. I interviewed and they’re calling my references. I’m going to assume they will offer me the job. The job is 35 min away in a well paying district but the position involves case managing a large number of IEPs (admin was upfront about this in the interview). They also said they want to open up other resource type classrooms (what I teach now) if they are given more funding (likely). Should I take the job now or wait until more jobs are posted and I might find one that’s a better fit? Not to sound cocky but I’ve done a lot of work in education outside if my classroom and have a pretty good resume. How do I tell my current district I’m leaving? If offered the new position can I ask to think about it for a few days? Can I accept the new position in the new district but then apply for other jobs within that district that may be a better fit once those are posted? 

Thanks in advance!",4.302829457364344,5.312519360465117,5.05872093023256,84.32329457364345,70.51162790697674,7.7100775193798485,27.414728682170534,7.9370924344782425,1.6268821705426348,1356,45,268,17,24,439,194,344,0.064,0.789,0.146,0.9848,11,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,7,5,15,14,2,0,27,0,27,1,0,2,1,40,47,22,0,5,13,0,0,1,0,5,0,2,0,0,15,10,0,2,6,1,5,3,8,5,1,3,8,4,28,9,34,32,8,44,0,0,1,1,24,18,0,8,21,175,43,25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08406813546997607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06879866333213877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058503778178540335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0853192673479721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08042702530468493,0.0,0.08082860837392053,0.0,0.0,0.052443473238052506,0.0,0.07320572925242264,0.0,0.0,0.1521742011822328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17569378304868774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05548263889351488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08988369714532196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08803920317891986,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11364483882607253,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08110202096618421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07863043679016267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04889318932361621,0.07215841033217521,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09158120483979752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09089608348003404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09711810902552036,0.0,0.0,0.5976048752699882,0.07646797637158619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0910940148021983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04203022000058392,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07224406141544261,0.0,0.0,0.07314016471966392,0.07764600198716548,0.0,0.05742611323253963,0.08722155527556562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09126490259583188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0663521250933695,0.41544459032753206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09161981268548668,0.11659316208386546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16478712400420373,0.08752407877491282,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0818348294739914,0.0,0.0,0.26120277004170056,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0728934731985827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060892922359974434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12936865348575072,0.0,0.07519456213976733,0.07920544506745407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05512495362143585,0.08452465668607058,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08220595325246609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.050743094258063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07735186778712261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12526264579716484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1662027143262923

teaching,hi_how_are_you_03,2018/03/16,"I Want to Become a Teacher - Advice Needed Hi,

I am a 54 year old woman looking to re-enter the workforce - hopefully as a teacher. I've been occupied as a homemaker for most of the past three decades but now that my kids are all out of the house I would really love to get a job in education.

Which brings me to this subreddit - I am very keen on pursuing any opportunity that may lead to me getting a job as a teacher, and I want to know if there is a path available to me.

This is my background:
- I earned a bachelors of science in biology and then an MBA a long time ago in India
- I worked briefly in the marketing department of Pepsi, but then quit to raise my children
- Since then, I have done some volunteering here and there (teaching Hindi, volunteering with the PTA) but never actually held a job

I am open to pursuing whatever degree or certification I need. If you have any input on how I can pursue this goal of mine or even an honest appraisal of my chances, it would be much appreciated.

edit: I live in Washington state in the greater Seattle area

teaching,SicilianCrowd,2018/03/17,"Help with unruly preschoolers Not sure if this is the right place to post. If not, please let me know.

Bit of backstory to help you understand the situation. 
I work with a preschool class, 4 year olds. Their regular teacher is in her 70's. She is amazing, and runs a very tight ship. The kids are very little trouble for her. However, she has been out since December, due to an injury, and just within the last week has started teaching again. She's in the classroom M-Th mornings. The rest of the time, I'm with the children alone. I'm in my middle 20's. Half of the class is very well-behaved. However I have some boys who couldn't care less about what I say. They talk back to me, yell at me, a lot of the time completely ignore what I say. Trying to sit down with the class to teach them is next to impossible because 2 or 3 of them won't sit still, talk to whoever is next to to them, or even start hitting/kicking. I can tell them not to do something, like call a classmate a name, and they turn around do that exact thing. 

I have them sit out. I've tried talking to the director. I've talked to parents and sent notes home. These students don't seem to respond to anything I do or say. If you have some advice, I would be more than happy to hear. I'm at my wit's end.",1.9812316085303363,3.700280973384032,3.092378905604232,93.25835344685072,77.66920152091254,6.24691684575963,23.602082988923787,7.079830092131019,0.6640819639609852,988,32,222,11,23,317,155,263,0.067,0.871,0.062,0.2139,3,1,1,0,0,0,39.0,0,2,8,1,7,7,0,0,18,0,23,0,0,0,2,34,35,10,0,5,10,1,1,1,0,2,0,5,1,3,7,11,0,2,3,0,0,2,6,2,0,1,2,6,28,5,38,28,7,35,0,0,0,0,35,14,0,10,16,139,35,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11792009444207448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12498066053421135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09930345842986303,0.10742440426586236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09278995882474853,0.0,0.07356103810950045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13174347813729592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12322045311321153,0.0,0.12303399425701485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1265231680545964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10688031121937018,0.0,0.0,0.0797032671909966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284584731593663,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1360070514675576,0.0,0.16176891071862265,0.0,0.1210446891739682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06631863238997476,0.09836446375681836,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12339614616371225,0.0,0.05895465010830499,0.12094587917141705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10259172614018378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25667385085797795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12662583742770533,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13399289884479024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12607742513766734,0.13246253174515135,0.0,0.0,0.11557121563825658,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10305393885647686,0.0,0.2878916374659209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10985601375027702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09982181331290313,0.13564131873188784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09289984132054784,0.0,0.0,0.17082570263751176,0.0,0.0963694792094504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11373271569550353,0.0,0.0,0.3879690041951675,0.10547337370433922,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0801696672871263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14073059708312474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16385786299160449,0.13125738872428871,0.0,0.12562467347014128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2987031718980045,0.0,0.0,0.0967964666508282,0.0,0.10849936784890314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0878512586242684,0.0,0.0,0.08572251730862562,0.0,0.0,0.07770934714768725
teaching,burntoutteacher1,2018/03/17,"Burnt out. Considering leaving teaching. Can anyone offer perspective? I'm completely burnt out in my current placement.  I've been teaching high school English for 2 years.  I'm debating whether to seek a position at a different high school or to leave teaching altogether.

I love teaching.  I really love it.  But I hate what teaching has done to my personal life and my family.  I work until 5 every day, pick up my daughter from daycare, and work for 1-3 hours in the evening after she falls asleep.  I work Sundays.  But I'm still barely keeping my head above water.

My question is this: is my workload at my current position unusually high?  If so, I will readily find a new placement and continue teaching.  If not, I think that my aspirations of work/life balance are incompatible with teaching. 

Here's my situation:
English courses at my school are semester long.  I teach 6 classes per semester (3 80 minute periods per day on an alternating schedule).  I have 5 unique preps.  I have approximately 130 students per semester.

Over the course of this year alone, I have taught 8 unique English courses (many of them Junior/Senior electives): Freshman English, Interpersonal Com, Expository Writing, Bible and Myth, Fantasy and Sci-fi, Outdoor Life, English Writers I, and Folklore.  I have taught 11 different courses over the past 2 years.

I enjoy learning and teaching new content.  But I find that I dump all of my time and effort into curriculum planning and prep, leaving little time to grade the 390 essays I collect each semester (we have a 3 essay per student per semester minimum).

This is my first teaching placement.  I feel very strongly that this workload must be unusual, but I simply don't have the experience to say that with confidence.

I need practical advice: if I apply at a different school, will I most likely find a more manageable workload?

teaching,gibsongal,2018/03/18,"Took a year off after graduation. What’s the best way to prepare for interviews a year after leaving academia? I graduated with my education degree last May and took my certifications in June/July (I hadn’t been able to afford $400 for my tests, so I took them late). I’ve been working at a daycare ever since, with the intention of applying for the 2018-2019 school year. But now that it’s almost time to start applying, I’m really nervous that I’ve forgotten what I learned in college. I also never got recommendation letters from any professors or mentors my last semester (I was going through a really rough time my last year, and had a hard time keeping up with what I needed to be doing). I was never close with most of my professors, and the one I was closest with, I asked for a recommendation for a scholarship, so I don’t know, I feel awkward asking for another from her, even a year and a half later? Is that logical, or should I try to ask someone else? Where should I start in preparing for interviews again? What, if anything, should I bring with me to interviews? At my current job, I’ve done behavior plans for certain students (you can see some of the previous posts I’ve made in this sub for more info on that), do I bring those? I only went on one interview last year and it was last minute and with people I knew from student teaching, and I didn’t have anything to show them. I’m just feeling really lost right now. Please give me any advice you can to help calm my nerves and get me prepared for the coming months.",5.911941675895164,6.125070495016615,6.730337763012184,76.59350590623848,66.64119601328903,10.144038390550019,32.33684016242156,9.994966539143718,3.0754738279808045,1213,47,234,26,18,403,162,301,0.041,0.895,0.065,0.8259,3,0,0,0,0,0,38.0,0,2,2,4,10,6,0,2,15,0,22,0,0,2,4,44,49,15,0,5,5,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,12,17,0,1,7,1,1,8,5,3,0,3,18,5,35,3,44,26,4,52,0,1,1,0,15,14,0,7,28,159,47,20,0.1003952004284405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09810502792828704,0.0,0.0,0.10053129117242744,0.0,0.0,0.08028600551083699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1365443579789112,0.10527312126800167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16523339145429225,0.0,0.2815678801341949,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1053585689579996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08648157557053399,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10273914650737914,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08386730752721673,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06631008303329923,0.09081320652122103,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10152565974974434,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05245234856477176,0.0963082243607458,0.05705690601178452,0.0,0.08029521305872217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08993437995686024,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06729278660718417,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09962674519166992,0.08923586702161684,0.0,0.0,0.05517457659415539,0.4091774395904171,0.11325015899041088,0.10630402133113942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10959322080193823,0.0,0.0,0.09499636609978353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08013449115589903,0.0,0.0,0.07444176901472309,0.1548619354763968,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13606077211704062,0.07635507390682365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06960139104246411,0.0,0.0,0.11020378195756356,0.0,0.0,0.0961508502138016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1929472084814655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857369526158326,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10160530267752772,0.08000197653104972,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08304794724978118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08506452752827816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14212047918902193,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17562374617991675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3346282850834588,0.06816175097687611,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07968903708816763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09306735661363684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0730889016129709,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3879073049398429
teaching,carebear233,2018/03/18,"Looking for advice! Is going into a post-bacc teaching program a smart decision? Hey everyone! My name is Carey and I am new to Reddit and the teaching subreddit. I would love some advice from current teachers.

My background: I am 23 years old and living in Washington state. I just graduated in December with a bachelors in Communication Studies and a minor in history. I loved my major, but I'm feeling stuck because I am in a lot of student debt and am having a lot of trouble finding jobs that I am qualified for despite my educational background. Additionally, I have a lot of other financial hurdles. I am currently working a full-time job at minimum wage and living on my own and paying for everything myself: rent, phone bill, utilities, etc. I also am wanting to save up for my very first car, and sadly, driving lessons, which are quite expensive- my parents did not help me learn to drive when I turned 16, and although I have my instruction permit and some practice with helpful friends, it hasn't been enough to acquire a license. Now that I am working full-time, this is my chance to save up enough money to do this.

I have been working with children since I turned 16 and have generally enjoyed it. I currently am working as a support teacher at a local preschool and have enjoyed learning about curriculum and early childhood education. This has led me to consider going back to school and earning a teaching certification to possibly teach elementary, preferably K-3. I am hesitant, however, for these reasons:

-Although I have worked with kids for years and enjoy it (and find it generally fulfilling), I do not know if I have a natural ability for it or a ""calling"" as they say
-I am not a very organized person
-I want to be able to live comfortably on my own, and I am not sure if teaching will provide that type of income, although it would be much better than what I have right now
-The job seems pretty high stress due to administration struggles and parents, and I struggle with anxiety issues

Any advice? I am scared of taking on more debt and am worried that teaching will not be a passion for me, even though I enjoy working with kids, have a lot of experience, and enjoy learning.

teaching,cilllah,2018/03/18,"I'm on my second practicum and would like advice to on becoming more confident. I am incredibly shy. The kind of shy where I can't make a phone call or order my own food at a McDonalds. I've gotten a lot better lately. This is my second practicum and whilst I do feel nervous; I know I have drastically improved.


I am still so nervous especially when it comes to behavioural management. I am not confident in my abilities. Just standing up in front of them scares me. Do you have any advice for a pre-service teacher looking to gain more confidence. I teach a lesson tomorrow and want to show my mentor how much I have improved on my last lesson. I do enjoy teaching and I want to succeed! 


EDIT: I should add I am on prac in a really hard school. Children don't listen. Crazy bullying even to teachers, drugs, inappropriate relations on school ground etc. It's really full on.

teaching,EllaBThompson,2018/03/18,"New teacher ignored with zero support I teach at a small school district in a very popular place to live, and I'm pretty sure I was only hired to fill a gap for a year. I was never told that, though. It was pitched as a great job with training. I receive no curriculum, mentorship, or support, while other new K-8 certified teachers who can teach multiple subjects and coach sports, get mentorship and lesson plans. It's a stark difference. They have mentors in their room every morning giving them lesson plans. I have nothing, and no one hardly ever talks to me. I asked for a mentor and they told me I could meet with the superintendent, who used to be an English teacher. The school announced their new teachers this year and failed to mention me. They have a poster of the announcement on the entrance wall. I'm not listed on the school's website. I'm pretty sure I'll be non-renewed as everyone has started to either ignore me or pick apart my teaching. I'm a first-year teacher, so it's really difficult. My question is: Are all schools this catty with no integrity that they just use people and lie? Or have I simply gotten myself into a bad situation that's few and far between? I am thinking about leaving teaching altogether.

teaching,ninabubba,2018/03/19,"Working while in credential program? I’m applying to a one year credential program in California and the school states the you “cannot” work during the time you are in the program because of time demands. I understand that taking classes along with being on site takes up a lot of time, but I just don’t see how it is feasible not to work. I also don’t want to be a sub and am not interested in a two year program. Does anyone have experience working while in a credential program?

What can I do to motivate myself enough to get through the day to day?",4.408586956521738,3.362404423913045,5.309913043478264,89.76552173913046,69.97826086956522,8.664347826086956,28.18260869565217,7.554174236665415,1.2222408695652174,325,9,81,3,5,107,57,92,0.042,0.7909999999999999,0.16699999999999998,0.9146,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,0,2,0,4,4,3,0,2,4,0,5,0,0,4,0,20,14,5,0,1,3,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,1,8,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,0,2,14,1,16,14,3,13,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,2,8,55,20,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2467125336656669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19258379105842854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43254804404037583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19801463771843847,0.2310052137611303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18836544289459764,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2260851090573297,0.1597168207846885,0.0,0.0,0.20433684190173296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11680490404899195,0.0,0.1270586849663944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14985272724509588,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19871725805217846,0.0,0.0,0.12286696976143535,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10922389306158407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14923318627802054,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.165772628393647,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2504470074870744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22626246402412264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2337215182307529,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14852845620261476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1627599597262462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2879405579424797
teaching,conservative1984,2018/03/19,"Physical Education (Easy or Hard Job) (Pro &amp; Cons) Good afternoon. I am a aspiring physical education teacher (gym teacher for short) and I went through multiple subreddits and I can't shake the feeling of what the true feeling is about being a gym teacher. Mostly I want to know, what can I wear when I start my career. I shouldn't dress like a regular teacher male (button down, khakis). Would a tracksuit, shorts, sweater, graphic tees which include sports teams (college mostly) and occasionally hats be okay to wear? Also is it feasible for me to enjoy a comfortable living under a gym teacher salary, which would include paying off car insurance, rent, and food? Also, from a scale of 1-10, how easy is the job (1 being easy) 10 being hard. Thank you and bonus points for people that respond timely. And please don't say we're not gym teachers, we are physical education teacher, I've heard that for sooooooo long here on reddit. Thanks again guys!",6.889090909090911,7.808090103448279,6.8549529780564225,74.08989028213165,64.63218390804597,9.775548589341692,34.78369905956113,9.800150414767053,3.4922137931034483,754,33,128,15,11,240,114,174,0.043,0.778,0.17800000000000002,0.9743,4,0,0,0,0,0,37.0,1,1,0,2,7,10,0,1,10,1,15,3,2,1,1,20,24,11,0,4,2,0,4,1,0,3,0,2,1,2,7,7,1,0,3,6,3,3,4,1,0,0,2,6,11,9,16,15,2,16,0,0,0,0,8,7,0,3,7,75,18,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3032227585694357,0.0,0.20541570629870848,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917201535873152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22924742335927906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15901524226769628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1877193567839214,0.0,0.0,0.33966256768211,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3762685204239586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10419118009004806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09262185218868796,0.0,0.16740738531981975,0.16777711685795124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13143464827950166,0.0,0.0,0.20810784243990385,0.17921948643592536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1507659228618481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1341895249200325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3490895372650942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.110548773824567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11182238341606766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17574756911615955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26935206341876955,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,bonedustbaby,2018/03/19,"I work for a federal funded grant and am seeking advice on what other career options I have besides teaching. Hi everyone! Right now I’m feeling pretty lost on my career and finding a direction to go in the future. I’m currently a site coordinator for a federal grant funded after school program at a middle school and I having my teaching certification in History and Geography in Michigan.  Through my job now I also hold a childcare license in my name for the program and have been receiving continuous training in this area. I graduated from college in 2015 and I found my current job in the fall of 2016, so this is my first actual job that is in my field. 

My job is dependent on whether or not funding will be continued the next year and we are about to rewrite our grant in hopes of continuing it for the next 5 year. There also isn’t any room to grow in the position I am in currently. From working in this position I’ve come to realize that I don’t really have a passion for teaching in a normal classroom and I prefer working with youth in the ways I get to in the after school program.

My question really is, what else could I do that is still related to the field with the education and experience that I already have now, if I do not want to seek out a teaching position?

teaching,whaleygreat27,2018/03/19,"Looking for new jobs while still at current position? Hi all, I am special education teacher (2 years) looking for a new position for the upcoming school year. Staying in my district would be optimal, but positions won't open up until the summer (if at all) so I'm also looking elsewhere. 
I have an interview this week at a new district, and have yet to inform my current administrators. I spoke with my union, who recommended waiting to inform my admin until I was offered a position, however I do believe that my admin would offer a positive recommendation and generally be a good reference.

teaching,aerosmithguy151,2018/03/19,"What is a novel study? So I have an abnormally upcoming open house. My 4th grade class, by the grace of God Almighty, was able to finish the book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh. My teaching partner gave me a rubric and expectation sheet for a novel study to do instead of the big missions project 4th (for us) usually does. But only that. There are no past student work samples. No pictures of past work samples. No sentence frames or general idea of what to do. The thing is, it sounds like a good idea. I went on teachers pay teachers and googled some stuff, but I still can't find out what a novel study is and how to gear it to the book we read. 

Can someone ELI5 or share a link of something real that shows what a novel study is or what the end result looks like so I can reverse engineer it?

teaching,Kurre_mk2,2018/03/20,"In need of a good education app/applet in order to teach 1st and 2nd laws of Thermodynamics! Hi,

I'm going to teach high schoolers about the laws of thermodynamics. I want to spice up the lesson by giving students some time to use a relevant app/applet on their laptop. My students are already used to work with computers in their daily exercices, but this time I wanted to introduce a specific kind of program.

So can you recommend any apps, programs or websites with built-in applets that can demonstrate the effects of 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics? 

Geogebra applets are welcome too!

teaching,Rexetpropheta,2018/03/20,"Help with where to start Hey everyone,

I have kind of a general question. So I'm graduating this year in an unrelated field to teaching high school, which is what I want to do (I'm double majoring in philosophy and the humanities). I'd really like to teach high school English or Latin, but I'm not sure where to begin. I've looked at the state requirements, and it seems kind of overwhelming. I would like to be able to teach a year or two in order to see if I enjoy it before I go get an education degree. If I can have tips, that'd be great. Even the alt. route certification seems like I have to have some serious background in either Latin or English (I specialized in Latin for humanities). Do I need to go get a master's in Latin or English in order to get my alt. route certification? Or is there a way for me to be able to teach to see if I like it first? Thanks for any and all help!

teaching,BareButtocks,2018/03/20,"Just turned 30, but still passionate about teaching physics in high school. Need advice. Hi Reddit. I need your help.

I went to a small high school in Michigan and I got a BS in physics in 2009 from MSU. Shortly after my graduaton I was briefly pursuing a degree in education but for an unrelated family issue I had to stop that and go back to Vietnam where my parents lived. This did not stop me though I got a master's degree in Astronomy here and I have been working for a small university as a researcher and have had few papers out for my research.

During the past ten years of living here though, at the back of my head I've always had this thought of going back to the States and finish off my teaching degrees and perhaps pursue a different career path in the field of secondary education. I really do want to come back and teach in high school.

How hard is this realistically considering now that I am in my early 30s. How's the job market? I have some savings but no where enough to cover my expenses without any financial support. What would be the best way to pursue and finish where I left off?",4.588796511627908,6.091066934883722,5.566904069767443,79.08430959302326,70.34883720930233,8.165697674418603,28.32122093023256,8.660442795831766,2.1426337209302324,881,32,165,15,16,290,128,215,0.06,0.8640000000000001,0.076,0.7423,3,0,0,0,0,0,15.0,0,1,0,3,17,4,0,0,14,0,14,2,1,2,0,27,26,16,0,4,6,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,10,0,2,1,0,1,4,3,0,0,1,10,1,20,4,32,14,4,43,0,0,0,1,4,23,0,1,14,120,26,13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11883306434808408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10118686056961447,0.0,0.0,0.08269700758831995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3740334571490335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12761916355357414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1047537608593228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12705355134857715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1256526563663319,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11464036429921998,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13822425061755678,0.0,0.19452063613345247,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1089360880497455,0.0,0.12480398259111995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08151068512919422,0.3854537778239172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12692623246933354,0.12067629633423015,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13212648515096256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21476261917027348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18034026826796626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1350303088370658,0.0,0.11608775042047124,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07790463114021537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3692186749086234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0971155983063891,0.20333798497766736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13799831182882075,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2389567440939082,0.09654246484934753,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1322736196424682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07172702655386977,0.096526066727765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11273101298394896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11722491831148475,0.0,0.08853142730721009,0.0,0.0,0.08638620468896951,0.0,0.0,0.07831099435376496

Two of my students have been working extremely hard to attend a school trip to Ecuador and the Galàpagos Islands where they will experience new cultures and foods, hike volcanoes, and see the ocean for the first time. They’ve been doing their best to make this dream a reality: creating and selling original artwork, hosting bake and craft sales, organizing a talent show, picking up extra shifts at work, and dog sitting. Unfortunately, they still have not raised enough money and are asking for help. Please consider making a donation in any amount—even $5 would mean the world to them! Each donor will receive two bookmarks or post cards of your choice featuring their original artwork (just pm me your address so I know where to send them!) I’m posting the links to their fundraising pages in the comments below. Thanks so much!

teaching,beardedkurta,2018/03/21,"[Request] Suggestions for Math Teaching Resources Hey!
So wanted to give some background, I am from India and over the past couple of months have been working with a bunch of kids from a local community. They are a mixture of 4th to 8th graders, who come from a low-income background, and many have extremely difficult home-situations - but nevertheless they have a zeal and spark to learn:) 

I have been working with them through an after-school program to help improve their academic levels, as unfortunately the standards in the local government school is extremely poor. 

I am focusing on improving their numeracy and mathematical understanding. Almost all the kids are way behind their grade-level requirements, and I am planning to start from scratch. 
Unfortunately, most of the Indian school textbooks focus on computation and procedures of solving a problem without delving into the conceptual understanding of the topic. 

Through my online research I came across this Canadian website called Jump Math which has loads of teaching material - which I am currently planning to incorporate in my lesson plans for the kids. 


I am reaching out to ask you all if you could guide me to any other websites/resources that you would recommend for me to use?

teaching,mpersonally,2018/03/21,"Tutor has Math Teaching Questions Hello all! I'm a private tutor, and the boy I've been working with has been having some trouble with the beginning of the Geometry unit. He's in 4th grade and the school uses GO Math, this chapter is all the basis of quadrilaterals and angles, so pretty important. I have one more day with him tomorrow before his test on Friday, and I wanted to see if there were any more fun or engaging activities we could do to really stick the concepts in his head. They had an early dismissal yesterday, and a snow day today, so even less time with the teacher, who is a stickler for the schedule.

Specifically this chapter covers quadrilaterals (trapezoids, squares, rectangles, rhombus), parallel, perpendicular, ray, angle, line, line segment, and the relationship between angles and line lengths to form a shape. Any tips are appreciated!",9.592400662251656,9.5777301192053,9.354031456953646,61.617272350993396,59.0662251655629,11.788410596026493,40.72930463576159,11.20814326018867,4.9352046357615915,692,33,103,16,8,225,107,151,0.017,0.877,0.105,0.9278,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.0,1,0,1,1,4,3,0,0,14,0,13,1,1,1,2,21,19,11,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,12,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,4,2,7,2,14,14,8,15,0,0,2,0,11,5,0,4,9,72,10,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.345220789324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21598724409247133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20265941943287,0.0,0.0,0.3273935630985184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16764968940299288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14425517407914942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2604987207963403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17199907722855953,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582323099486122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2843432282665721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16260744516962874,0.0,0.0,0.27251414900254584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2568854788951254,0.2022664714553396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1480079909017127,0.0,0.2405973836765373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.219224180789298,0.0,0.0,0.14971316039667526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18478836239832735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,kbrrr,2018/03/21,"[Recommendation] App for grading on iPad and with stylus I’m looking for an app that will allow me to use my Apple pen, or stylus, to “physically” grade papers that are sent and viewed via Word/PDF. 

I’m on the go and find marking on Word a bit much when I’d rather substitute the pen and paper with the iPad and stylus to mark “papers.”

Does anyone have a reliable app they use?

teaching,elguapo51,2018/03/21,"Project revolving around a movie or documentary? Has anyone here ever done a project revolving around a movie or documentary? There is an amazing documentary on the Donner Party and I’ve always wanted to do “more” with it. We briefly touch upon the story as part of our Westward Expansion Unit but I feel like we could maybe build the unit around it. I’d love for it to be higher level, tactile and offer some degree of choice and options to students. Maybe start with exploring the “typical” wagon train to see if the Donner Party was unusual in any way? Exploring the ethical issues that arose? Playing “what if” with choices along the way?

teaching,maxfunmaker,2018/03/22,"Preschool teaching = student teaching? I have my bachelor's in something other than education and am soon to be starting up a Masters of Education program! I was told in some states, because I've been a preschool teacher for the past year, it could count as field experience and I could bypass the student teaching portion of the masters program. Does anyone know which states that it might count towards? Would save me 10K and 6 months if I don't have to do it. 

Thanks!",4.931412520064203,6.844956876404496,5.013515248796152,81.76370786516856,70.12359550561797,6.8834670947030485,36.30979133226325,7.447530270364453,2.7191431781701443,378,21,67,4,7,118,63,89,0.0,0.914,0.086,0.7932,0,0,1,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,5,0,12,0,0,0,0,11,16,5,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,6,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0,6,2,11,8,2,11,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,3,5,46,12,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2028434747293769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17684122955745746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4632397700717314,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2538669750751633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2837718004483477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15943043757694744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3077484497876068,0.0,0.0,0.2315536933607271,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2769316502648524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22333184233158096,0.0,0.0,0.20533306809418636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.267083536397262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27720135514519595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20607750721315551,0.0,0.0,0.18681379234001727

teaching,sad_eggy,2018/03/23,"Teaching charter school in New York City Hello teachers and aspiring teachers! I need your advice. 
I am finally finishing my MA in Philosophy at a New York private university (The New School for Social Research). I should be finished with all my requirements for the degree by December. I thought academia would be for me but balancing work (I have quite a physical job now) and school turned out to be a lot harder than I anticipated and I'm just not cut out for a phd. Besides, even back in high school I admired the profession of secondary education and the significant impact teachers can have on young students. 

After graduation I plan to (hopefully) get a teaching job at one of the many charter schools here in New York City. My rationale is simple: I really do not want to spend time trying to get DOE certification *yet*. I am aware of some of the downsides, among which include worse hours, less pay, nightmare administrations, and so on. However, I have heard there are some great charter schools here that teachers love. 

So.. how hard is it to become a charter school teacher in NYC? When do I even begin to apply / when are they scouting for staff? I don't have any real teaching experience, outside of leading seminar presentations in graduate school. I have heard about a teacher shortage and that it won't be too hard to find a job, but I have also heard reports that conflict with this. I have heard that there is a specific teacher shortage for men, and I am (weirdly) hoping to capitalize on that? 

Are there any pointers or advice you can give? How realistic is it for someone with an MA in philosophy to get a charter school teaching job? I feel competent enough to handle courses on humanities, european civ, philosophy, history, politics, feminism and gender studies. Are there classes like these in NYC charter schools? I also really wouldn't mind teaching reading or english which I imagine is in much more demand.

Thank you so much for your help and time.

teaching,mayranav,2018/03/23,"Teachers of NYC... I saw the starting pay for a teacher with an initial license is $54000 with an almost $4000 bonus if you teach in certain high needs schools. I have the desire of teaching in a high needs school. I have experience working with special needs/foster/homeless populations so I’m hoping I’m prepared enough to teach in a high needs.

I live in NC and do not want to teach in NC. I am currently filling out the NYC school district application with the hope of possibly moving to NYC. I do have friends (Brooklyn) and a boyfriend (Soho) that live in the city so I will know people if I move there. 

Social Qs: How manageable is it living on a teacher’s salary in the city? Are you able to still go out and enjoy yourself on the weekends? What boroughs or areas do you suggest living in? How long is your average commute? 

Do you have any general advice on teaching in the city? I do have questions about teaching in the city but I am not quite sure how to articulate them.

teaching,schid,2018/03/24,"What to do about students' vandalism &amp; disrespect for the classroom I've always taught in communities that appreciated and cared for the supplies in our room (I usually have baskets of tape, yarns, sharpies, etc).  This year I switched schools and am in a more affluent neighbourhood and while the majority of my students are generally good at cleaning up, taking care of, and respecting the supplies.  There are a a handful who arr lazy, disrespectful, and just treat the supplies like consumables for them to destroy, play with or vandalize.

I don't want to take all the supplies away and punish the whole group but I don't know what else to do.  We've had many class discussions about it, and I am just not sure what else to do.

teaching,AdeptNewt,2018/03/24,"Help! My mentor teacher has me so disheartened and doubting my ability to teach... So, I’m currently in a graduate program. It’s a language program, not necessarily centered on teaching, but I picked it based on the opportunity to get teaching experience. Most people in my program are continuing on to get a PhD and want to do research, I’m here because I want to teach this subject at the middle/high school level.

&amp;nbsp;

I started out taking a pedagogy course, absolutely loved it, did practice lesson plans in class and felt fairly confident. I was paired with a mentor teacher, my mentor is the only one from the country where the language we teach is spoken. It *is* a country that, according to the stereotype, has a lot of rude people. I don’t think that’s the source of the problem though, I spent two months in that country, didn’t have trouble communicating and people were perfectly sweet and encouraging.

&amp;nbsp;

Right off the bat, I felt like an annoying burden. This teacher already does a lot, and seems constantly exasperated by having to mentor me. The first semester things went ok, I taught one segment of classes, got a lot of criticism, but since I was getting positive feedback from pedagogy class too, I still felt ok. My mentor teacher has said a few times she doesn’t really buy the sort of pedagogy we studied, and I noticed that in her teaching. (Although when our director observed her, her lesson plan was totally different than it normally is, following the model we were taught in class).

&amp;nbsp;

This semester on days when I do teach, it’s the full class time. Time management is my biggest struggle, I get stressed about finishing, and I really am trying to work on that. However, my mentor sits in the back of the classroom and makes these **awful** faces as I’m teaching. She’ll furrow her brows and shake her head like my exercise didn’t make sense, even though she looked over my powerpoint before. She’ll shake her head, rub her temples, exaggeratedly sigh, mutter under her breath. Sometimes she’ll write something angrily and then underline it really hard, but a lot of times she loses those notes before we meet again. All of this totally destroys any confidence I have, and makes me more anxious or hurry or change something.

&amp;nbsp;

She gave me a big stack of papers to hand back before the students left, I was nervous about getting it done in time so as they were working on a speaking exercise, I handed them out (about 10 minutes before the end of class). She pulled me aside, sighed and said the rest of class is useless because I handed the tests back. Which I get, I should’ve waited, so I tried to reel them back in by previewing their homework, but she shook her head through that too.

&amp;nbsp;

She told me exasperatedly that it’s fine, because I’m sure she saw on my face how distressed I was and said she knows she makes faces but it’s because she wants to help. I managed to force a smile and sneak up to my office before I broke down and cried. My good friend/office mate was there and heard me out, she told me I absolutely need to talk to the director. I think I will, but I don’t know what to say other than that this has me questioning my ability to even teach, and next semester I’ll be an instructor of record. A semester and a half of feeling like I can do no right has just come crashing down on me, I’m *dreading* teaching Monday, and meeting with my mentor to hear how awful last class was. If she has anything positive to say at all, it feels very patronizing and insincere but I don’t know if that’s just me projecting. Or if this is a culture difference problem, or me just being too sensitive, or just not being good enough.
I guess I’m just looking for insight, I’m feeling so disheartened and questioning whether I’m totally in the wrong line of work. Has anyone else had an experience like this?

teaching,massage-ball,2018/03/24,"How to get better as a teacher while still studying? Hey all,

I'm studying to be a secondary school teacher and I'm in my last year. I feel totally unprepared. Even though I have passed all of my professional experience placements, all of my mentor teachers have seemed to give me a very ""I'm not sure if this is for you"" vibe.

My problems in the classroom are:  
-Bad at maintaining behavioural boundaries  
-Generally seem like I am not confident in front of the class  
-I really need to know more teaching activities/strategies that I can bring into class so that I don't rely on powerpoint so much

I basically feel like I'm a ""remedial"" level student. I mean my grades are alright but my actual teaching just isn't there yet. But I really wanna grab this by the balls and become a good teacher. Can anyone give me suggestions on how to catchup? Do I do volunteer experience? Read more books on teaching? Watch teachers on youtube?

Teaching seems to be very hard to learn when you don't have presently have a class to work with. I would study harder and do better in my uni subjects but I just feel like that's not going to fix the problems that I have.

teaching,Vnightpersona,2018/03/24,"I want to pursue a Masters in Education, but what does it actually get me? Long story short, my original college plan of getting a Bachelors in English secondary got derailed because of student loans. Left college for a while, decided to finish bachleors online. Close to finishing my bachelors, and considering doing a Master's in Education (more than likely online with my schedule). 
But I need to know what can I do with a M.Ed (possibly a teaching focus) really? Will it enable me to teach in an actual classroom with the appropriate state certificate? (I live in PA)
I've been trying to research this for the passed few months and have been getting different answers, which is unnerving to me. My college advisor says yes, actual teachers have told me no, the curriculum supervisor at my current public school job says yes, Google hasn't helped at all. 
Can anyone offer me a concrete answer? Please and thank you!

Edit: Forgot to mention that my current bachelors isn't in education at all.

teaching,jha1234,2018/03/25,"Advice: Want to be an elementary teacher, but I will have an engineering degree, and my family doesn't support it? Basically, I am a senior electrical engineering major, about to graduate in May. I have wanted to teach elementary school for most of my life. I just love interacting with kids and the idea of helping them learn socially/academically and hopefully inspiring them to lead kind and impactful lives. That’s the dream at least; My mom is a teacher so I know some days are more about just surviving than changing the world, but every job has good and bad days. To summarize a long story, I messed up in high school and chose a college major for the sole purpose of making money.

During my sophomore year (2 years ago), I rediscovered my desire to be a teacher, much to the chagrin of my family. I met with an adviser in the education department about changing majors, but because of the course sequence/prerequisite requirements, I would have had to add two more years of undergraduate coursework, essentially making me a freshman all over again. I opted to just finish what I started, and tackle the issue in a few years with an engineering degree in hand. 

I have now reached that point, and I have another decision to make. Until recently, I have been full-steam ahead interviewing for full-time positions in order to please my family, with most of them in engineering or management. I even got really excited about one of those companies. However, what I really want to do is to get an MAT, which is a Masters in Teaching (a 1-year, ~40 credit certification program for people who want to be teachers but have a bachelor’s degree in a different field.) I know there are other ways to get into teaching and get certified without paying for a year of grad school, but I want to do this because I want to do right by the kids. I want to know what I’m doing to as great an extent as possible so that I can be a great teacher.

So, I guess I am just looking for advice. What would you do in my situation?  As far as jobs I can work in the meantime, Is subbing/working at summer camp good experience for future teachers? Have any of you been in similar situations? Was it worth giving up the financial stability of another type of job? Would the student debt from a year of grad school be crippling on a teacher’s salary? Any advice or comments at all are appreciated. 

I am a male (I feel that bears mentioning due to the disproportionately low number of males in elementary ed.), and my MBTI type is ISFP.

teaching,smugsprinkleddonut,2018/03/26,"Help with applying to jobs! Hi there,

I'm currently in a career switcher program and will receive my provisional license in May (endorsed in middle school math, hoping to get certified in algebra and English this summer). We have been told that we can start applying to jobs now with a certificate saying we will be getting our provisional license in two months. 

I'm having trouble coming up with references/reference letters. As I am a career switcher without student teaching experience, I don't have any relevant people to ask. I have volunteered with many tutoring programs a couple of years ago but never developed a strong relationship with admin. I don't want my current job to know I'm leaving but I only had my last job for about a year before I had to move and never developed a strong relationship with my supervisor there, either. 

Basically, I'm worried I won't be able to get a teaching job due to my lack of schmoozing and cultivating relationships over the years. Submitting references to be an admin assistant (my previous jobs) is obviously much easier.

I'm looking for a webapp or cellphone app that will allow me to quiz students as teams. To clarify, I want my students to get together in groups, discuss certain topics and then take an individual quiz, but their contribution will go towards their team and the team with the highest score ""wins"". I want to encourage peer teaching and I thought this might incentivize teaching each other.

Edit: thanks for all the valuable advice everyone!

teaching,closemyeyes5,2018/03/26,"Ideas for student introductions for an assembly? Hi guys,

I work with an educational vendor that provides career readiness services to schools. I will be giving an assembly about college to over 100 middle schoolers. I'm stuck on how to have them introduce each other to make them comfortable and be a sort of icebreaker before starting. Since there are so many students I can't do a traditional ice breaker kind of thing. I really don't like the intro that my company gave me, I think it's too young for inner city middle schoolers. (They suggest an alien greeting thing) they said I could change it. Does anyone have any possible ideas? I would like them to speak to each other and introduce themselves. But a targeted little theme would help them actually connect rather than just saying ""hi my name is...."" 

any ideas are very appreciated! I've never done this before so I'm a little nervous :)

teaching,syphiliticseahawk,2018/03/27,"Question on NYC ""initial certification"" Hi everyone -- I was accepted to an NYU GSE for a program that gives 'initial certification', the note saying that after a few years you can apply for the full certification.

Question being, what if I don't want to teach in NYC afterwards? I am currently working overseas as a tutor/sub at an international school and would like to return and be a proper instructor afterwards. Will the initial certification be enough? Do I have to labor in expensive NYC for years until I'm fully certified?

teaching,distraction_pie,2018/03/27,"Teaching with no tech (and minimal prep) for high school ESL classes I work at a school that relies heavily on computer resources -no textbooks, everything is supposed to be paperless, all records/grades/assignment submissions are online- which was great until this morning when there was some kind of network issue and all the computers went down. And are apparently staying that way for at least a few days until they can get a specialist out.

I made it through the day getting my classes to play vocabulary games like charades/hangman/ect but my students can't just play games all week so I'm looking for any ideas of things that I can pull together fairly quickly to keep them occupied until I can get them back on track and with minimal resources since this is my first year of independent teaching and doing my own lesson planning so I don't have much to fall back on.

The pay for the Kuwait school is greater as they stated it’s not the most desirable location, however, it’s an amazing school.

teaching,CuriousistheGeorge,2018/03/27,"Teaching in Texas? Houston/Galveston Area? Hi everyone,

I have a question for anyone who might have some help!  I'm currently finishing up my education/getting my license in Iowa and searching for job has brought up a huge point for me.  The districts I'm looking at in Iowa pay roughly 31k/32k a year and now I've been looking around the Houston/Galveston area and see the salaries there start around 52k/53k.  So I have a few questions!

(1) How bad are the classrooms?  I've heard that they can be rough as any classroom could be- BUT there would for sure be a culture shock there coming from Iowa.

(2) Is the cost of living comparable ?  Is that bump in starting salary because it needs to be that high to reasonably live in that area?  Salary is not the biggest factor but I'm coming out of school with some hefty loans for going into education.

(3) Is it a desirable area to live in?  I can say for sure that I would love the warmer weather (I HATE SNOW).  Still though, any major downfalls?

Thank you so much!",3.0258385601308966,5.476104673575128,3.167433869648214,90.44598036542135,77.39378238341969,5.721188982819744,27.77447504772293,6.8360192770164,1.2841772020725388,794,34,155,8,19,242,119,193,0.057,0.8190000000000001,0.124,0.9237,4,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,1,1,0,11,7,1,0,13,0,20,1,0,2,2,27,37,10,0,5,3,0,2,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,8,10,0,0,3,0,3,4,1,3,0,0,3,7,10,4,27,26,5,32,0,0,3,1,11,21,0,5,7,97,18,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1967429916428261,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10114730682440017,0.0,0.0,0.25755020989054395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12078227680882425,0.08818136313783939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2492178241793023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11549657986095455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13822564693499606,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07557713938586405,0.0,0.08221171895198907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428185128742264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09696031640592936,0.15283771364220758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14354942369478174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3832034684884082,0.0,0.2429503395135577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1305582920938876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15345786654921886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10633929657096836,0.10726108757567897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13674730994644066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3240971523881237,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14873114889042713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11503678976516453,0.0,0.14640027249341972,0.11527263691472955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2047774705834326,0.0,0.11552300320888875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2726743983267027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13318042613774686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14212444342697353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20551989537258508,0.0,0.0,0.0931541524717774
teaching,wanderthrust,2018/03/27,"School district already posting jobs? (CA) I'm in my final semester of my credential right now, and I've been kind of poking around online looking at jobs. I've been told that most jobs get posted over the summer, but a district I really want to work in just posted a bunch of jobs in my subject matter (Single Subject ELA)!

The kicker is that on their website, the deadline to apply is mid-April. What's the deal? Is this normal? I'm going to apply, but I'll really be scrambling to get together my letters of rec by then since I didn't think anyone would post them that early...

teaching,drbzy,2018/03/28,"MY FLY WAS DOWN THE WHOLE CLASS HOUR. For context, I teach at the college level. Two students kept snickering and it was really distracting. I finally asked them what was so funny and one of the students (who I regularly joke with in class) said they would tell me about it after class. I moved forward, ignoring it for the most part. 

We get to a point in the lecture where students break into groups to complete a short activity and a student who was sitting near the two jokesters comes up and whispers in my ear that my zipper was down.

teaching,Jutman1776,2018/03/28,"In need of some advice (MAT Student) I was just accepted to a Nursery-grade 3/Special Ed. MAT program at the University of Saint Joseph in the Hartford, CT area. I've been working as a teacher aide for the last 2 years with students who are autistic and have behavioral problems. I love the work, just don't enjoy not being payed a living wage. I'm a 27 years old male and feel like my time is running out to find a career in which I can possibly help raise a family with. I'm very hesitant by the fact that I will not be able to find a job specifically in a public school after graduation. Am I right to feel this way? Or is this just an irrational over analyzing fear of mine?

teaching,OhioGuyT,2018/03/29,"Question about managing tutor/student relationships. So I'm a guy in my thirties, belatedly pursuing my master's degree and thinking about getting into teaching. I've been volunteering as a tutor for a local nonprofit, mostly working with 6 to 8 year olds on basic reading and math. The tutoring takes place in the cafeteria after school, typically with 20 or so kids spread out between anywhere from five to ten or so tutors.

There's one girl I work with a lot, 7 years old, from a troubled home. (Dad not in the picture, mom doesn't have custody because of drug issues). She's grown pretty attached, always insisting on working with me if I'm there, getting anxious and acting out if I pay too much attention to other people, and so on. 

She's affectionate, wanting to hold hands whenever we walk anywhere, leaning her head on my shoulder, trying to sit on my lap (which of course I've avoided), etc. Recently she's started (playfully?) saying stuff like ""You're my daddy"" a few times. I'm new at this, so I'm basically looking for guidance on how to navigate the situation. I understand this girl is in need of something, but I don't want to cross any lines or possibly be hurtful in how I deal with the situation. Do I need to set firmer boundaries? If so, how? 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!",6.624756097560973,7.181294727642277,7.546650406504064,70.16704878048782,65.13821138211382,10.137235772357725,37.94471544715447,10.047579312681364,4.065697886178862,1037,53,175,22,15,349,159,246,0.046,0.903,0.051,0.4625,0,1,2,0,0,0,40.0,1,0,0,4,14,7,0,1,11,0,9,5,3,3,0,38,25,21,0,8,8,2,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,4,5,13,1,2,5,2,1,4,3,3,0,3,2,3,17,4,40,20,5,32,0,1,1,0,15,17,0,9,10,114,22,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11100305816122392,0.0,0.0,0.18143898706631115,0.0,0.0,0.15070887851119652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08132201849864228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13753396781231558,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15470662624882175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14878104997790698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13939647355200305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14707870344794688,0.0,0.13209122337532878,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1369112912519255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13381538250608974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1428120542623899,0.0,0.0,0.1392394218544351,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06517459880802542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11202600697660893,0.0,0.0,0.11341555890715695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15624149505507134,0.0,0.0,0.0980675046875759,0.19783518506918776,0.0,0.1288426969984226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2799707279381637,0.0,0.09039820113324938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.092485739257724,0.0,0.1393790920139612,0.0,0.0,0.15039329543883104,0.0,0.13572012518891666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14944333861490622,0.0,0.13344039360356266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13172064483730458,0.14322628499019618,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060884478581258,0.0,0.13501226613276707,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29990402839815833,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10270114191625056,0.0,0.0,0.09442424486487196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15271599822363988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10030342559652464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08548008400950972,0.0,0.10590810684681043,0.07778911576997431,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09057275772478723,0.0,0.0,0.13887857325528027,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15737061621381607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2913597413485555,0.0,0.0,0.094766581841127,0.0,0.0,0.17181598108647336

teaching,Epimenide,2018/03/30,"School for students from 10 to 18 years old: better to divide it in two sections? I am an architect, I m working on a project for a school for students from 10 to 18 years old in Europe.
The school will have 1000 students, 40 classrooms.
I am doing some research and I would like to have also your opinion.
Concerning possible social issues, bullying , and educational topics, do you think that it would be better to divide the school in two different sections, one for students from 10 to 14, the other one for students from 15 to 18? Or are there reasons to say that it would be better to have a mix?

I am concerned about some “communal areas” like the wardrobe for example, where the teachers are not present and a mix of students with a big difference in age could maybe be problematic.

What is your opinion? Anyone has experience about this topic?

teaching,Luckypenny9,2018/03/30,"Seeking advice as a new teacher Hey guys, I am new to Reddit, and so I thought this would be a good place to post my story. I posted a very similar post to ECE subreddit as well. Short version, I just received my license in ECE to teach, which is P-3. I've been graduated for 3 years now, so it's been a struggle if you can imagine. I've already applied to jobs online but I haven't heard anything back, but it has only been a couple of days. Do you have any advice to give to me? I am nervous and worried I won't hear back from anyone because it did take me some time to get my license. About how long did you wait until you heard back from prospective jobs? Does anyone think that because my license is only P-3, I might not get that many offers, because that does concern me too.  Thank you :)

teaching,Orian3030,2018/03/30,"Logistics of carrying... In my state, teachers are allowed to carry a concealed weapon. The caveat, they cannot store it in any way in the school. Must be on their person the whole time, for good reason.

How in the world could a teacher carry a weapon for all 8 hours with all the moving and bending down we do? Unless I wear a jacket at all times. If any of my students so much as glanced at it, they/parents would freak out and mass social media chaos.

Could a teacher logistically carry a decent 9mm/or larger weapon with you? Any thoughts from someone that has a concealed carry.

I guess the Louisville Slugger under my desk will have to do for now..",3.4737012987012967,5.5555728492063485,3.767748917748918,88.45149350649349,74.47619047619048,5.534199134199136,24.946608946608947,6.11248444174946,0.7075015873015875,513,17,98,3,11,159,87,126,0.11,0.867,0.023,-0.8645,2,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,1,1,2,0,3,5,3,0,13,0,12,1,1,3,4,20,14,7,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,3,6,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,4,0,0,1,1,9,1,22,7,5,20,0,0,1,0,6,13,0,2,4,70,12,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.453455538926381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549304835219197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1864303005376933,0.0,0.0,0.2448564753421388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21889208127064705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2362388099337832,0.16339469962986433,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19407839230395388,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2285315229853666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2249500356044604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2265772097755524,0.1883294276175112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17645828107620345,0.2592159196096678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17642830893542746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2481575423167929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15789488296056955,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,jcf1211,2018/04/02,"Wanting to teach with a BS in Psychology? Last May I graduated with a 3.2 from Georgia State (I transferred there after 2 year at Agnes Scott). I’ve been a Office Manager since then and I’m wanting to look into teaching.

As I understand it, if I’m wanting to teach in say Florida (where I may want to move), I’d have to apply for a temporary teaching license and pass certification tests for subjects. Then finish a teaching class type thing sometime in the next 3 years to get the license.

My question is more... what are my options to teach with a BS in Psych? Humanities of course.. but I always wanted to teach English. How common are teaching jobs for humanities classes?

Also, how soon do schools typically hire for teaching jobs? Is it too late to try and be certified for the next school year?

Last question.. since I did not major in education or have advanced degrees in teaching, what would you recommend to someone with some teaching experience to learn how to lesson plan and run a classroom well? I did teach with VIP Kid for a few months but the odd hours didn’t work for me. I also have coached several seasons of volleyball. I prefer older kids. I’d love to coach volleyball too.

Any information and advice is appreciated!!",4.326594827586209,6.561902607758622,5.362448275862072,77.27737931034484,72.49137931034483,7.915862068965517,31.85862068965517,8.697196308434329,2.8524510344827583,983,47,172,19,20,323,136,232,0.013,0.87,0.117,0.9775,2,0,0,0,0,0,33.0,0,1,0,4,11,2,0,0,12,0,17,1,0,3,0,36,28,17,0,8,5,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,4,5,11,0,0,7,2,0,4,2,0,1,0,4,2,13,2,38,20,4,32,0,0,1,1,10,9,0,8,18,111,18,29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13265384124757415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21711929050612105,0.11295531098166513,0.0,0.0,0.09231501162115152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13279006126789694,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07092404606071598,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13368692159403828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2694228974753233,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22130959140317646,0.15313250430913786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11399625078525424,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12252014825275635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10835477337634733,0.14428132382750414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28874444534000443,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30414331040983444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10795426556601673,0.0,0.27477355597205266,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15335945263062012,0.0,0.2245884730487481,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1150209787288844,0.0,0.13426073968399088,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09018661634808472,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09216569511455296,0.0,0.0,0.1413210833160633,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4003458820924945,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12205602434588199,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09882799848560114,0.0,0.0,0.0964332776038167,0.0,0.0,0.26225666071813697
teaching,nobodytrickedme,2018/04/02,"Want to ask my former boss if she'll give me a positive reference, not sure how to phrase the question Last year I worked as an IEP case manager and co-taught. I was on annual contract and at the end of the year my contract was not extended. I'm applying for a position in child protective services with a county law enforcement agency nearby. They ask for 10 years of job history and several references. I have the references set up, but I'd like to ask my former boss if she'll give me a positive reference.

Over the last several years went from being a substitute to long term substitute to paraprofessional to faculty member to substitute for the county. So I'm not sure if I got non-renewed, as far as the county is concerned there seems to have been no break in service- I still have access to my county-email which few if any subs have.

It's possible my boss will tell them to contact HR and HR will only say I worked for the district from 2009-current. But if they do ask her for details about my employment I want to make sure she'll say something good about me.

teaching,SilZeroChris,2018/04/02,"Making better video resources (Secondary ELA, Social Studies) Hello! 

I teach predominantly low-income students who often are behind in their skills. We all know that having multiple modalities for instruction is best for our students, and that videos can present information in a new way and can be a resource for them to revisit. 

However, in the years I've been teaching, many videos are: 

* Too long
* Too complicated
* Too fast
* Too clever

My students do not understand or cannot connect to these videos. So, this summer, I'm making my own. 

**What topics do you feel would benefit from having a short, easy to understand, direct to the point video?** I want these videos to be as useful to as many people as possible. 

I’m focusing my efforts mostly on ELA, but I also have a credential in Social Studies.

I appreciate any help I can get with this. ,8.657792207792205,10.226326727272726,9.418597402597404,54.96503896103897,60.94805194805194,11.354805194805195,42.67272727272727,11.20814326018867,5.66923064935065,366,21,49,10,5,124,54,77,0.0,0.831,0.16899999999999998,0.9054,1,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,1,0,0,0,7,8,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,4,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,5,0,14,7,0,8,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,1,1,31,7,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5088282802832729,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5311473248617277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820450154730496,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2278368454657578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13602380469500988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1745092662826208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18389516928442293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19304860366939786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39150641980888395,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2543272519146116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18954023509736065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Jess0262,2018/04/02,"Advice on going into teaching for soon-to-be grad I will be graduating with a degree in math education in May. My original plan was to go straight into a master’s program and get my teaching certificate. However, I have been questioning my decision to teach and have decided I would like to try to get a teaching job to see if teaching is for me before entering a masters program and getting certified. 

How likely is it that I would be able to find a job without a certificate? Does anyone have experience with this? I am looking for a job in the Charleston, SC area.

teaching,allie-the-cat,2018/04/03,"Is this something I should address with my principal? I’ve been in a long term sub position for a little over 2 months now. I’m teaching outside my area of specialty (jr high science, I’m elementary trained and don’t have a science background). 

Now, my boss has been getting a lot of emails from parents saying how I’m unqualified and how they need to find someone qualified to teach science (not easy at all, especially since this is a french immersion position. FWIW I can speak french more or less well enough for immersion). 

Up until now I’ve been the person until the other teacher returns, and whenever her sick leave is extended, I’m told I’ll be there longer. Now, today they had someone else in with me to see if they wanted the job. Apparently my principal has more people lined up. I only was told today to come in for tomorrow. 

Now, this makes me feel like shit and completely undermines my credibility with the students. How am I supposed to teach or plan when I don’t know more than a day in advance? How are the students going to get on board when they see that the admin is actively looking for a replacement?

I want to talk to my boss about it, but I don’t know if that will do anything or it will accomplish anything.

teaching,gpickering,2018/04/03,"looking at going into drama teaching? hi, apologies if i’m posting this in the wrong place (please redirect me if i am) but i’m currently in year 12 (england) and looking at potentially going into drama teaching, but i’m just wondering (if there are any drama teachers here) how feasible it would be. 

obviously there’s the risk of arts being cut - either to a larger extent or entirely - by the time i leave uni in 4/5 years or so and even if this doesn’t happen i’m just not sure how available arts teaching jobs are in the first place. two of the drama teachers at my school teach other subjects (music &amp; religious studies) and the other is part time, so i’m not sure if i’d have to be capable of teaching another subject on top of drama to be able to find a full time job?

other than drama, i’m studying history and psychology but i can’t imagine doing degrees or going into careers around those subjects if i’m honest, so any advice would be massively appreciated - thanks very much!

teaching,wynnmary,2018/04/03,"Stay in your Lane How would you and your coworkers address this?

I teach 4th grade which, as you know, has specific grade level expectations. Over the past year plus a teacher in 3rd grade has continuously used material our team is using...to the point where each 4th grade teacher has had students announce ""oh we did that in 3rd grade."" 
It is really starting to take the wind out of our sails. 
It has happened primarily with big projects: example- an animal vs. animal book focusing on text features, animal adaptations, camouflage etc. I actually had this teacher's son and she literally used the presentation her son made in my lessons to show and model to her students.
There are far more examples. One other one to note is the 4th grade has a HUGE week of ""writing camp"" in which we transform our classrooms and hallway into ""camp"" and have student pep rallies in preparation for the state writing assessments. Supposedly the kids ""did this last year"" as a reading camp in 3rd grade..l

It's unfortunate when you have a few ""special"" units in your grade and the team one year prior uses them a year early...

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what approach to take in addressing this?

They just want to play at the playground.",6.980349544072952,9.080733478723406,5.58969604863222,78.90500000000003,65.27659574468085,7.924620060790273,33.641337386018236,8.418075326091056,2.8614273556231007,433,19,68,6,7,127,72,94,0.034,0.894,0.073,0.5514,0,0,1,0,0,0,10.0,0,0,3,1,6,3,0,0,4,0,8,0,0,1,0,17,15,6,0,3,2,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,4,3,3,0,1,6,2,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,7,2,11,11,2,7,0,0,0,0,7,3,0,2,5,45,10,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2098968919473622,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20956066583294844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17335873474963626,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5925925955232678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23329509319699898,0.0,0.0,0.14424646073669334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12822941782162925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19294539994558868,0.19461792684585305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17785623410714022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2389425204207684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.202061967060635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16817995980565476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732401721240854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1548114055812479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1910810381809118,0.26655067989527303,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,isooleil,2018/04/04,"Any CA (specifically SD teachers) out there willing to talk about finding a job and pay? Hello! I'm a confused person in the workforce right now.

Some background: I graduated from UCSB with a Math B.A. and Science and Math Education (7-12th grade) minor in June 2017. I conducted STEM education research my last year, volunteered as a math tutor at various HS, interned my freshman yr as a clinical research analyst, worked through college as an admin asst., and am currently a payroll temp back in SD (hometown). Immediately after graduation, I started an Applied Math M.A. program at SDSU, but dropped out towards the end of the first semester because I felt unsupported, disinterested, and highly stressed (lost weight/hair/meh).

I started my education minor my senior year just so I could stay for the full four years, but the minor had me interested about a career in teaching HS math. I took and passed the CBEST with a high score, but did not pass the CSET math subject tests, so I was unable to apply for my top choice teaching programs (UCSD &amp; UCSB). I also had some reservations about becoming a teacher, considering the budget cuts occurring in education right now and the salary I would have as a CA teacher.

Therefore, I decided to take a temp job while I worked towards my other interest in data science. However, I've realized that I have a lack of experience and schooling in order to enter this field. I'm interested in this field because of the analytical skills used (feel like my degree would be worth it), implications of the data analysis you conduct (improve society/research somehow), and higher pay and job security. So to enter this field, I'd have to take the GRE again (my first score was not great) and get relevant letters of rec (SDSU's program didn't require LOR) and apply to CS or Data Science grad programs. CS programs are an option, depending on the school, because Data Management and Analysis are part of the curriculum, and I think the CS programs would be more versatile in the workforce.

Either path requires more schooling, but different kinds of preparation. I want to be in a position where my work makes a positive difference in society, but I also am afraid of job prospects after completing school, being in more debt for a non-practical degree, and how my standard of living will be. Also, I am young, but I feel very old and like my life and opportunity to start a career will pass me by, esp. since it's already been almost a year since I graduated.

I suppose what I'm looking for from this forum are opinions/experiences of the people who are/were in similar situations (how did you decide what to pursue?) and of the people in these positions (teacher). I'm sorry for the length of this post! I just wanted to be as thorough as possible. Please let me know if there's any more info you need/want.

TLDR: Can't decide between teaching or data science. For CA teachers, how difficult was it to find a job after graduation, and what's an average salary, or the salary I should expect? I looked at salary schedules in the two districts near me, and they seem reasonable, but also not much info on how that salary is decided upon.

teaching,Dreadking_Rathalos,2018/04/04,"Picking up second certification? I graduated a year ago with a degree in music education and the job search has been somewhat brutal. I'm currently working in an unrelated field. My aunt is a teacher and suggested I pick up a certification in a more in need subject so I can get a job more easily. 

Only problem is she got recertified in 1979 so things are probably different now. I'm waiting for my old college advisor to email me back but does anyone know what the process is like? I'm in SC.

teaching,arv1995,2018/04/04,"App for improving math skills Research has found that students are struggling more and more with basic mathematics. With coming of calculators, students are not even trying to use mathematics in daily life. Seeing this as a major problem, I built an app that will push them to solve mathematics in mind and can eventually help them train their brains. I would really appreciate if whosoever is reading this, give a try to this app and provide me with feedback! New innovative ideas are also welcome.

teaching,zeeplereddit,2018/04/05,Curricula for Chromebooks? I am interested to know how Chromebook-dominant schools discover quality browser based programs for their schools. At my school we are using an internally hosted application server for our reading assessments because the online equivalent is prohibitively expensive. I would like to be able to suggest an alternative to my curriculum director but I am not sure where to start. We also have need for a quality online writing assessment. Where do you folks go to discover Chromebook friendly curricula?,9.129285714285713,12.392812404761903,9.318571428571428,49.626428571428605,61.85714285714285,13.371428571428574,47.714285714285715,12.28987398476788,7.9635428571428575,438,30,50,18,7,144,63,84,0.029,0.875,0.096,0.7019,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.0,3,1,1,0,4,4,0,0,4,0,8,0,0,2,1,11,13,3,0,2,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,10,4,11,11,0,5,0,0,0,0,8,3,0,0,2,39,10,6,0.24339486211131184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1946427832942744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14837124883362182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18804626670013908,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13832690917465698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13376345089082728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11891043527822,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18047420621043825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2434607282176743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7389857840645113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1722761361488667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2293967770800361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21021501335051876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17290072670412615,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,eastallegheny,2018/04/05,"This is the kind of thing that makes it all worthwhile There's a boy in my class who is just riddled with anxiety. Like, he's a nervous wreck a good 70% of the time, and so quiet and shy the rest. The other classroom teacher, B, is a jokey blokey jolly type, which is lovely, and HE'S lovely, but he's not at all right for this child N, because when N gets in a state, being jollied along does the exact opposite of good. 

Anyway, I knew about this last year, because I taught his sister and got friendly with his mother. This year we've got even friendlier, and we chat fairly often, and she's told me more. Like, that he's dyslexic. Or some of the ways they're trying to combat his anxiety, etc. And we had a great conversation about the things that DON'T work when he's upset. 

So I was talking to her this afternoon, and out of the blue she tells me ""yeah, N really likes you. We were talking about what teachers he could talk to if he needed to, and he named [other classroom aide who comes in a couple of days a week], and then he said 'oh, and I can talk to Miss eastallegheny.""

I don’t know if it’s coming across but that was of the most gratifying things I’ve ever been told. This is a child who B tells me will burst into tears and sit there crying rather than ask for help...  But he feels like he can talk to me. 

Tonight I am happy :)",3.916231884057975,4.340335840579712,4.626956521739132,89.1999275362319,71.02898550724638,7.292753623188408,23.66666666666667,6.937597516519254,0.6054362318840587,1036,23,230,8,18,333,157,276,0.077,0.722,0.201,0.9915,0,0,0,0,0,0,42.0,3,1,0,1,15,15,0,2,18,1,18,2,0,1,4,45,36,23,0,5,9,2,1,4,1,1,0,2,0,3,22,22,0,0,3,1,0,2,3,3,0,0,12,4,21,12,29,21,7,25,0,1,1,2,47,8,0,6,16,147,43,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18624327239011204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11379930827178952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14840859661914754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20971589813775895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09718995443902564,0.13468978811786084,0.13371256299670695,0.07850453132210634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10652504959713532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1357589693319841,0.0804002385894081,0.11011000344711958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06154936695470144,0.08696255363569576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09404680071046737,0.0,0.06359788958588224,0.0,0.0,0.20419945038835494,0.19471410657913688,0.13420562090227758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12958178823578767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08159175574922432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1267610472077596,0.06689856081181493,0.09922461943518346,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2378807344649595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21972866167150698,0.0,0.08125442831987716,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09025981745183098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07798211517485136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10395510201337094,0.11579126483169334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4892020365338003,0.2127913875936217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24261215147199874,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07098061334925568,0.0,0.0,0.2326327644349361,0.0,0.08264536538825676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662207166339136,0.09764291085695152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08861948076538638,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15677776511542954
teaching,dannitohoot,2018/04/05,"[Strategies] What are the best time saving tips you would give to a rookie teacher? I'm always looking for new ways to make my work flow more efficient. I'd like to hear from other experienced teachers - what's one strategy you would give other teachers for how to keep on top of grading, lesson planning, prep and all the meetings and parent phone calls in-between so that you have a life outside of your work?

Some tips I've learned include:
* Never take grading home, do it right at school.

teaching,999_999_999,2018/04/06,"Notified finance dir. and screwed my school over Hey everyone, please let me know how big of a dick I am or am not. I am not too sure tbh. 

HS in suburb of large city in the upper midwest. 

Every year my school of 880 makes a budget for staffing the next school year. They base the staffing off of how many students register for next year's classes. For the past few years we have had more and more students taking the PSEO option to go to college while in hs. This past year we had 50, this next year it is looking like 60. 

When making the budget for staffing we have always asked the PSEO kids to register for classes to help our budget, getting more FTE's. I have always thought this was weird that we would base our budget off of fake student registrations since we know and the students know they are taking the PSEO option. 

So here is the bad part. Please take into account I am not smart when reading this. I see the district finance director outside the bathroom one day, his office is in my building. I proceed to explain all of this and question if this is the best way to make a budget. He seems very intrigued, thanks me, and we part ways.

Today the new budget came out and everyone is up in arms. We are basing the FTE's off of the actual students who will be coming in the fall and we are losing 2.8 FTE's. I feel very responsible for this and I don't know how to control my feelings. 

Thanks for reading and please be nice I already feel really bad.

teaching,ThatGuyRy,2018/04/06,"Becoming a teacher (Connecticut) Maybe this is wrong place for this and if so I apologize.

I’m a 31 year old male in CT. Since I was 18 I have been working in Information Technology. I received an Associate’s Degree in General Studies and went no further. Wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do. Six years ago I was considering going back to school to become a teacher but ended up getting the job I am at now. Fast forward to today and I make a decent salary ($55k/yr), own my own house, getting married and all that. But I am so unhappy. I never wanted to be in IT as a career. Especially Corporate IT. I work 3rd shift and the work is completely unsatisfying and uninteresting to me. In the back of my mind, and really now the forefront of it, I keep going back to wanting to be a teacher.

When I think about my life, some of the best times were elementary school. I still remember all my teachers, and many of the lessons they imparted on me helped me become who I am. I think even back then I wanted to become a teacher but I was either unsure or trying to “be cool.” Now I’m wanting to give back and help form young minds. I also love teaching kids how to read and write when I can. I have done some tutoring in college for English/Creative Writing classes and loved it. 

I know the landscape for teachers isn’t painted as attractive or great in the media. I know it’s hard work. I’m not afraid of that. I guess I’m afraid of not being a good teacher and not being able to find a job. Also how long it might take me to get a bachelor’s degree and find work. 

So I guess my question is: should I do it? Am I too old at this point? Did I miss my chance?",2.065401960784314,3.84551905,4.204705882352943,85.10284313725492,77.61764705882355,7.121568627450981,25.450980392156865,8.021203637495839,1.5255215686274504,1287,48,268,22,30,443,172,340,0.054000000000000006,0.828,0.119,0.9789,3,1,0,0,0,0,40.0,0,0,1,7,21,12,0,2,19,1,28,3,0,3,4,57,56,31,0,7,10,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,14,13,0,1,10,1,0,5,7,4,0,1,9,2,39,8,37,40,9,43,0,1,0,2,15,15,0,9,25,192,53,15,0.08837854775666604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07834225012985001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14135258542143198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3397882397134543,0.0,0.0,0.3904286497895353,0.0,0.0,0.0927478333475269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09266322585062828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09044193873145856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07827716116966255,0.0,0.0,0.05837319727534269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16155278307440413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13852243053845506,0.08478075614872396,0.1004551307490912,0.07412773276649394,0.0,0.09743766090540623,0.1947178684790877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916981947407807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11847655524292172,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10197697818023306,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17540414322971776,0.07855491399510492,0.0,0.0,0.0971410770967298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06242438194470293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07821223365394063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1595301797585416,0.0,0.058993366898244914,0.08960197586368039,0.08878813010576947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09375567282373064,0.17847427868458668,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0681629843945871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18547683799737325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0923367719906926,0.0,0.08354629410120025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09900419986830053,0.0,0.08840246424683433,0.0,0.11323512150994487,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10011566624005784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.178887617270448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07310764798302698,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07057922240169769,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08329573534350716,0.0,0.06644966906703613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11325880966624086,0.0,0.0,0.051534241918366266,0.0,0.08377252944097077,0.0,0.0,0.06000323260653905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2606397863804851,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0819277991972105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3217031767513825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09662806807505694,0.0,0.11382577430156955
teaching,tkyocoffeeman,2018/04/06,"Teachers who received their CA credential through National University's online program: downsides? I'm currently living and teaching social studies at the high school and university level in Japan. I have a Japanese teaching credential, but I'm thinking about moving back to the US to teach high school in California (my home state).

I can't afford to take a year or two off to go through a traditional program (I'm still paying off the student loans for my first masters degree) but I found that National University offers an online credential program. NU is listed as an approved program on ctc.ca.gov, however, I know the school's reputation as being a bit of a degree mill. How important is this when it comes to hiring?

I'm debating going back to where I grew up (Orange County) or where I worked after school (San Francisco). If schools in these areas get my paperwork and see that I got credentialed through NU, will it affect my chances of being hired as a high school social studies teacher? Will I be less competitive? Any guidance would be appreciated!",6.625082706766914,8.571249884210527,7.216541353383462,67.49578947368423,65.94736842105263,10.06015037593985,36.72932330827068,10.290406445055957,4.41809022556391,858,44,129,22,14,282,117,190,0.0,0.914,0.086,0.9373,3,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,1,0,1,4,8,0,0,0,12,0,11,0,0,2,0,15,25,13,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,7,4,0,0,3,0,2,6,1,0,0,2,2,1,14,0,25,16,2,32,0,0,1,0,7,17,0,3,8,87,21,18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08169808289842505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18475769123998032,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1311597783039408,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10348840530253356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1021894755168894,0.0,0.13172531466780188,0.0,0.0,0.06276724113234547,0.0,0.13655459387046548,0.0,0.09608547830048532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3807977532988416,0.12050839116591246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06602480247731657,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10608421499240578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12768787381112295,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7295175191947759,0.09573457603690984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2449314926569971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09594250665831996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.090328960846612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07697969551627798,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11735754622688348,0.0,0.14451143970404984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08746202671887128,0.0,0.0,0.08534271695892116,0.0,0.0,0.07736504977812055
teaching,zdrums24,2018/04/06,"GA position offered; when do I inform my Admin? I have been formally offered a graduate teaching assistant position and I have indicated my acceptance of the position. I have not signed the payroll paperwork to finalize the whole arrangement as the forms won't be prepared until late april / early May. If the GA position falls through, I can't afford to attend school.

However, my position is going to be split across two buildings (1.0fte between the two) next year and I'll have to apply to the position at the new building soon if I want to come back in fall.

Do I indicate my intention to not return before I sign payroll with my graduate program? How big of a risk am I taking if I do that? To the knowledge of my union rep, this district does not do anticipated positions, so Im effectively stuck resigning once I make this known as far as I can tell.

teaching,storybookheroes_13,2018/04/07,"How do you find your joy? So this question goes out to any teacher that is currently teaching curriculum you hate... how do you find your joy in teaching? Most of my career I’ve been teaching curriculum I love, but this year was moved to freshman English, which I really dislike. I was moved because of state testing and the need to pull test scores up. The kids are fine, but what is being taught are things that, even when I was in high school I disliked. I feel like I’m watching the deterioration of any love they may have had for this subject. I asked to be moved out of freshman English for next year, but was told that the superintendent wants me at all freshman English since grades, and state based testing scores have gone up. I’ve communicated how unhappy I am, but it’s not going to change anything. So, how do you find your joy? What are some strategies I can use to help the curriculum seem more interesting? How do I find my joy in this?

teaching,punkinholler,2018/04/08,"Is it always my fault when my students don't understand a concept on a test? I recognize (and own) that most of the time, if my students fail to understand a concept, it's probably because I didn't teach it very well. Normally, I can think back and figure out where I dropped the ball when this happens. However, I have a situation with a couple of classes right now and I honestly don't know whether the fault is mine or theirs.  

First, I teach biology to college freshmen and sophomores. They're mostly not science majors, and I know that so I don't expect them to study as hard or to know as much as science majors would. I expect them to work hard and learn the information, but I'm not at all unreasonable and most people usually pass with an A or a B unless they just don't turn in their work or take advantage of any the many opportunities they have to pull up their grades. Anyway, when we first started going over Punnett squares, I told them there would be a big essay question about this information in the future so they should be absolutely sure they understood them and could answer questions about them. They've had a homework assignment on Punnett Squares and an extra credit assignment involving Pedigrees (which are related but make you work a little harder to figure things out). I also told them more or less exactly what they needed to learn to do well on the question (review the terminology for the different types of alleles, review dihybrid crosses and when to use them, etc..) a week before the test and again a few days before the test. And, finally, I told them to be sure to practice doing Punnett squares sometime BEFORE midnight on the day of the test so they'd know if there was a problem before it was too late to do anything about it.

So far, they've almost universally bombed this question. What's more, some of their mistakes make it pretty clear that a not insignificant number of them don't even understand the most basic fundamentals of how it works. I keep trying to figure out how this happened or if (or how) I let them down, but I honestly cannot think of anything else I could have done. This has always been a challenging question and other classes have struggled with it in the past, but not this badly. Furthermore, I made sure to give them ample warning this time because I know it's hard AND I told them exactly what they'd need to know to answer it well. 

So my question is, this. Is this my fault (it's okay if the answer is ""yes"". I'm honestly more interested in being an effective teacher than in vindication)? If it is my fault, does anyone have any suggestions for how I can approach this differently in the future. If it's not my fault, how do I get the little horsies to drink once I've led them to the trough of water labeled ""What you need to know to answer that question""? I realize, that you probably can't answer any of these questions exceptionally well without knowing more about the situation, but I welcome any advice you can give.

teaching,KhloeKodaKitty,2018/04/08,"The title of my teaching memoir would be..... ""Are You Kidding Me Right Now?""  

It just covers everything:  my kinders when they're acting loony; the parent who wondered why I don't send home weekly class photos; the admin who messed something up and now is making us clean up; the district heads who wake up and say, ""Hey, let's change programs mid year!""

The sequel would be called, ""Seriously?""

Side note:  my kids pick up on the ""seriously?"" very quickly--I must have said it to a parent about something once and she said, ""OH! That's where Natalie gets that saying from!!""  Luckily, I usually have pretty damn incredible parents so it's never been an issue.  And if it was.......""Seriously?""

teaching,Receptron,2018/04/08,"I would like to become an English teacher, but I have some doubts. I've never been the brightest kid. I'm less than lackluster at math and science, even being in some concepts classes in high school, although never English.

I was close to being in the army, and being a pilot; none of those ever clicked. I finally found a passion and I really want it to work out... but I think I might be too dumb honestly. I just started county college this year, and I really want to declare as an English major. 

I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice, or for someone to give me a pep talk... I feel lost. I feel stupid. I have incredible problems with self confidence when it comes to picking a career and committing due to this, and I just need some help I guess. 

Sorry for spelling errors etc. I'm on mobile and I guess if there are any maybe I shouldn't teach English haha.",3.6420125223613615,5.003759569767446,4.937441860465119,83.22902504472273,72.48837209302326,7.152772808586764,28.34704830053667,7.61054688173877,1.745266010733452,674,26,129,8,13,224,110,172,0.179,0.696,0.125,-0.8982,0,0,0,0,0,0,25.0,0,0,0,2,7,10,2,1,8,1,12,1,0,1,5,42,30,15,0,8,8,0,2,1,0,3,0,0,0,2,5,11,0,0,4,0,0,1,5,5,0,0,4,4,17,5,20,19,7,17,0,1,2,1,5,8,1,10,9,91,22,7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16338939209513886,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11370416030309605,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18466320500216035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14403106913366615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18647617725696586,0.11043638012629343,0.1512452003842132,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16908629637916536,0.0,0.0,0.18316333655610728,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18333008270934895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16039689875596427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3683871630211624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11207302753303136,0.17665975033948236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08168721783978335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1404088863296923,0.0,0.1825224466340934,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16797845834642086,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1773765633244069,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1239793274886306,0.25791539975566763,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15999123381560607,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21422977507524044,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16921893799631788,0.0,0.0,0.17442978779377316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1416710410792118,0.0,0.0,0.18717070589060344,0.1183475464475594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15758738463312466,0.0,0.0,0.13439189488256315,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1071372953750807,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19724199371145165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12172618932613805,0.0,0.0,0.11877661782913138,0.0,0.0,0.1076736161944628
teaching,NEMM2020,2018/04/08,"When should I take the Praxis? How ""easy"" is it to pass? I am trying to the Praxis as soon as possible, but how soon is too soon?

I am halfway through college and I am interested in getting certified in Maryland by the time I graduate. I cannot submit a transcript analysis until I pass the praxis according to the Maryland State Department of Education (see http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/about/Pages/DEE/Certification/apply/Career-Changer.aspx). I need the transcript analysis because the pathway for my certification is a nontraditional pathway (see http://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/comarhtml/13a/13a.12.02.06.htm).

Note: I requested the analysis without any of the documents and MSDE said they could not analyze it because I didn't complete the Praxis. So the sooner I take the Praxis, the sooner I can figure out what courses satisfy 13A.12.02.06 (A) (2).

teaching,Jazzarya,2018/04/09,"EDU/ECE Student Need Survey Participants Hello r/teaching!

I'm a senior studying Elementary Edu. and Early Childhood Edu. For our senior project we had to write a literature review and conduct research on our topic.

Unforunately I have not gotten enough participants from my community and was wondering if you can help me out.

The survey is open to anyone who works at a school. 
The survey is about how educators perceive therapy dogs in the classroom.
Your responses will remain anonymous. 
The survey will take between 3-7 minutes.

teaching,Digimountain,2018/04/09,"Student teaching a grade I am struggling to get the energy to handle - how can I be a better teacher? I'm in my first year of a two year teaching post-degree program. I had my first practicum, three week observation period, in November 2017 and started my five week second practicum two weeks ago.

My first practicum and this one are in the same class. I thoroughly enjoyed my first practicum, though I will admit it was very tiring and grade 2 is certainly not my favourite grade (I am aiming to teach grade 6 or older). This practicum I am teaching 25% (around two classes per day). I am EXHAUSTED.

I can barely make it through the day. Around lunch time I just start to crash. I feel like I cannot eat enough to give myself energy; I am starving constantly, my eyes are hard to keep open, and I just have no energy for this. The last thing I want to do when I get home is lesson plan, but for school I have to keep a running record of these extremely detailed plans (nothing like what my cooperating teacher actually does) and I just need sleep.

How do you deal with extreme fatigue associated with the job? Does it get better?",5.055729646697387,6.188221976958528,5.2778064516129035,82.9900430107527,68.86175115207375,8.36731182795699,30.134869431643626,8.648137234880735,2.202352012288787,887,34,174,14,15,280,124,217,0.063,0.8290000000000001,0.108,0.8161,1,0,0,0,0,0,29.0,0,1,0,9,9,9,0,1,9,0,20,7,2,3,1,28,34,11,0,2,6,0,2,2,0,1,3,0,1,0,9,10,2,2,3,0,0,1,3,3,0,11,2,3,28,6,20,30,2,27,0,1,1,0,4,6,0,1,22,115,37,14,0.0,0.0,0.11752159601857835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10675328214057928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2144151667246018,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21301980660962225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13014125828526338,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15533383340234633,0.12415729000367735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21077693260030445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1232292090704206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12443562934974925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06089265773292533,0.08603469501184033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4097483043579589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1887579701318288,0.11552673003692432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10788097177865894,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12080037765967708,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11950746857406158,0.2140861382804,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0981659290564787,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11767131703964033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08038747330428646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08929677822967179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11555513317946445,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0816059905232122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1153379515529528,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12188085130485556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12051624322420028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17048091521746034,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12589882167636288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08000785619942972,0.0,0.11832114695610901,0.0,0.07022327617975907,0.13841573074527835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3529256950887913,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.099366760655817,0.0710323040413532,0.0,0.2898032901898785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15510500373355335

teaching,blublu0,2018/04/09,"Help, my students dislike me, and I don't know how to deal with it!? I'm a language teacher and I teach adults. 

My lessons have always been fun and entertaining and I always found a way with students. Sometimes there were a few people in my group who wouldn't like me too much but it's normal, I mean, you can't appeal to everyone.

Last month I got a new group and started off with a wrong foot. Yes, it was my mistake, I was too fast because I thought their level was more advanced. Next lesson I apologized if I was too fast and continued with a slower working pace. since that lesson ALL of my (adult) students are behaving passive-aggressively, as if they had this common hatred towards me.  There's always this uncomfortable tension...
I tried to be extra nice, tried to prepare the most interesting topics, etc.but it seems to never end...


Any advice?

teaching,graniteknighte,2018/04/09,"Advice Please Hi all,

This is my first post to the community and I am a middle grades education student who  is one final class and my student teaching away from getting my Master's Certification in Middle Grades ELA. 

My question is this for the community, I have a project to begin that we were put into groups for (the project is on Integrated Unit planning) where we have to have a central theme and the it across a whole team of subjects  (ELA,  Maths, Science, History) my confusion is this: my group mates have come up with the idea of a theme of ""Community Engagement"" and found ways to the all their subjects to this theme while telling me after (I missed the planning meeting because of a family emergency) that they skipped doing suggestions for ELA because it is the easiet to do.

My question to the group before my anxiety eats me alive is thus: what the hell do I do to create a 10 lesson unit plan (which was the assignment instruction) tied to this theme?? I have no idea what to do and I am completely burned out from anxiety.

teaching,Sskrzypek090,2018/04/10,"Worried about student teaching Hey all, I am shifting into a teaching career. I have been working in business over the last couple years and am not satisfied. A mentor of mine asked me what I would do if I had no fear of failure. I knew it would be to teach. I am heading into student teaching soon, but I have a full time job with benefits that I would have to give up. I have a wife (working part time while she goes back to school), a 4 year old, and a baby on the way. I am scared that I will not be able to do my student teaching for a while because I don’t know any other route to take to support my family in quitting my job to student teach. I thought about government assistance, but I don’t even know where to start. The good thing is that I own my house, but have bills and a car payment. Any advice is welcome!

teaching,AlabasterTire,2018/04/10,"What's the realistic daily time commitment for a high school English teacher? **TLDR: Please give my SO and me a feel for what the work schedule of a high school English teacher is really like.** 

I have an MA in English and taught college for several years. I'm currently in the middle of a family-raising gap, and SO thinks that when our children are in school, it would be nice for me to get a teaching certificate and start teaching high school English. While I agree that the (small amount of) extra money would be nice, I worry that he's underestimating the time commitment. He speaks of it as a 7:30 to 4:30 job with summers off, whereas my hunch is that it's 7:30 to 4:30 in the office, and then another two hours at night grading papers, more grading papers on the weekends, and multiple weeks of additional training required in the summer. He doesn't seem to ""get it"" when I say that a) it seems all teachers work a lot of unpaid overtime outside of school and b) English teachers work more overtime than most due to the grading load of papers. (I spent eight years teaching college. I know how much time grading papers takes.) 

To make sure I'm presenting the issue in a balanced way, I thought I'd get an accurate perspective from people on here. What are your experiences and observations regarding how much time a high school English teacher really puts into the job? I don't want either of us to be surprised if this ends being a 50-hour-a-week job for 32k a year. I want us to go into it with our eyes wide open if that's the case.

I'm a substitute teacher getting ready to start applying for teaching positions and was wondering what a cover letter should look like. How different are they from cover letters in the private sector? My roommate, who's a high school teacher, said I could use my experience as a sub in cover letters for schools that I've subbed for, but what about cover letters for schools I haven't been to? I know each one is supposed to be school specific, but I'm rather lost as to where to get school-specific information to include in the school-specific cover letters. Are there any resources that might help me with this? Thanks.

Large class sizes, students from low-socioeconomic families, teacher shortages, etc. I strive to have a safe and welcoming classroom environment and it's really important to me to cultivate meaningful relationships with each of my students. They know quite a bit about my personal life (young, engaged, no kids etc) and I try to be pretty open with them. In terms of my management, I have routines and rules that I teach and try to consistently enforce, and am not afraid to call parents when necessary. Here is my issue: In some of my classes (mostly 6-8), I seem to have little to no authority over the students. They blatantly ignore me and my directions, will not participate in class or do any of the work. I've called home, met with parents, led restorative practice sessions, but nothing seems to stick. If the students are not led to class by the principal or a dean, they will more than likely run into my room screaming and roughhousing. No amount of supervision or redirection or positive enforcement on my part will deter them. I guess what I'm asking here is, what can I do to show more authority to my older students? I feel as if I don't have a lot going for me (younger teacher, i'm white and i've heard students comment about that...) Sorry for the long post, but it's almost June and in my third year I'm at my wits end...",7.873601485148518,7.3981841056105635,8.113116749174921,70.62531868811884,62.72937293729373,11.271369636963696,38.07941419141915,10.686352973137794,4.112373102310231,1276,58,227,28,16,419,169,303,0.053,0.8690000000000001,0.078,0.6514,2,0,0,0,0,0,46.0,1,0,5,3,6,8,0,1,13,0,16,1,0,2,1,49,31,21,0,3,11,2,1,1,0,3,1,2,2,2,7,19,0,2,6,2,0,4,7,3,0,2,2,5,32,5,46,25,15,31,0,0,2,0,19,16,0,14,11,156,39,21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723139053078177,0.0,0.0,0.13952428883060128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09475285863066576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13025980194857092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15211818308042993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28455406993877885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14364869226559476,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12340981868429053,0.0,0.3107916335605733,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13135302653135206,0.0,0.07045217120679823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07918752600635152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15349366586961102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1397647796234004,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454299703510482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07657509886772887,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09841672260670076,0.06807224452713921,0.13965068822190732,0.0,0.12330745558344305,0.11700665412261345,0.0,0.0,0.11845798517074226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1336960863539713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30943097307188944,0.15088667378504445,0.0,0.0,0.12166230792626165,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1334448094725929,0.14175420667071664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14820036250977406,0.0,0.0,0.08926183324371667,0.0,0.0,0.14959408838533286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1410148763849577,0.0,0.2536914532457609,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15597458692609828,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1891991979728106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.101437839900702,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2691823124060843
teaching,Bukiwithabeehive,2018/04/11,"Electives, suggestions?  Pre-service teacher here.  I recently got hired to start next school year teaching at a middle school.  The school is a charter school and would like each teacher to also teach 2 electives of their choice.  As a new teacher with no experience,  I barely feel any confidence in my own content.  What are some suggestions for a middle school elective course I could teach.  I'm currently considering creating a reading elective ( I teach ELA and would like to provide students with independent reading time). But I'm drawing a blank on the second elective.  Another teacher is already covering creative writing.  

I don't currently practice any hobbies since I have been working two jobs + grad school.

teaching,misspushkin,2018/04/11,"Advice wanted - am I unreasonable? This is my first year teaching (besides teaching a few classes for a whole year as part of my training last year, so technically it's my second year).

I missed the boat last year when it came to applying for jobs, since I had no idea I had to start looking for work in April/May.
As a result, I've done a lot of subbing this year. I've just turned down 2 positions, and for one of them, the team manager went off on me completely. I would like to know whether I was unreasonable or not in turning these positions down.

For the first position, they needed someone to immediately take over all final exams at an external location. All students were 2 weeks behind in their finals since the teacher quit from too much stress and being overworked (big red flag to me). It sounded like way more stress than it was worth, so I turned the position down.

For the second position, within the same school (it's a gigantic vocational school, so there are many options), I was already hired to finish the school year for a teacher on pregnancy leave. However, I had trouble getting in touch with the teacher I was supposed to replace. I talked to another teacher and there were no books available, there was no planning available (for what I had to do), no end goals and the scheduling was unclear. Meanwhile, they wanted me to start immediately with pretty much only 1 day to prepare all my classes without materials or a planner, to then teach what I guess would be random stuff next week. I told the team manager that this situation sounded strange and that I didn't have a lot of faith in it. He then went off on me completely, saying he expected me to be flexible, and that he expected me to deal with things on my feet and that I complained too much (since he'd already wanted me to start this week, but I told him I would at least need some time to prepare or know what I'm doing).

Am I reasonable in rejecting these positions or am I indeed too unflexible and do I expect too much? At this point in my career, I don't know. I mean, I don't expect everything to be perfect, but this all seemed like a bit ...much?

teaching,jaytlipk,2018/04/11,"Masters pay bump question Hi all. I have a pretty unique situation that I need some advice / guidance on, and I’m not sure if this is the place to ask it. My girlfriend was just accepted and received and offer letter for a major school district in a major city for August 2018.  She will be receiving her masters degree as she is currently finishing up her last class and graduating next month. This was never discussed in the interview process, but she technically didn’t lie about anything. She is extremely worried the offer will be pulled once the district realized that she is going to be more expensive than they previously thought. Does anyone have any advice for me to pass along on how to best manage disclosing this information or any other general tips?  Is this common?  Should she be worried? Etc. Thank you.

teaching,hahaman3,2018/04/11,"Advice in teaching English. Not sure if this is the right place to make a post like his. Hopefully it is! Also in advance considering the name of the thread please ignore my terrible punctuation and grammar. Anyhow I've recently arrived in Mexico and people have asked me to teach them English.  So I've started with the super basics! Them being the Alphabet and numbers! I've had the 2 kids I've been teaching identify objects and such items in English among other small things like the weather. 

Well my dilemma here is that it'll come to the point where I would need to teach them grammar, punctuation and things such as past,present and future tenses. That among other things. I was wondering if 1. There's a place where I can find resources/ guides to teach that and 2. What advice can you give me in terms of what's wrong and what pace I should go at. 

I've been in the U.S. since I was 3 and you can pretty much say I'm fluent in the language! But there's a difference between being fluent and teaching it! I'd very much appreciate the help! Positive vibes here please!",3.7991720085470098,5.921412197115388,4.404166666666669,84.06861111111112,73.66346153846155,7.122222222222224,26.459401709401718,7.984000788550335,1.68410811965812,859,31,160,13,18,273,117,208,0.066,0.785,0.14800000000000002,0.9564,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,0,2,3,2,11,9,0,0,14,0,17,0,0,1,1,27,27,16,0,6,4,0,0,2,0,3,0,1,0,1,15,12,0,1,2,0,0,3,1,3,1,0,5,1,15,6,20,17,4,25,0,0,0,0,12,17,0,5,6,108,30,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30535493019749604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12494633621896505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14606478757147642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1345882878246227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16323919826617794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14280197486973942,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14988116179232513,0.08879569131384969,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10472543859959994,0.0,0.0,0.1551831441439688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1526634892366236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10429246883855403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2297110794718194,0.11585115289852907,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14915026857589764,0.10831823991200484,0.0,0.3264783965323559,0.3430126758819167,0.14769879619102266,0.0,0.14963624584525378,0.15895385817411456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15426971253473068,0.0,0.0,0.1334294568495044,0.0,0.12424957662896101,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12924465071269994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11058859550532167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14725584145216186,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3113998925404813,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12891566761972428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14047994556283624,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16943733023837232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11098953665605857,0.17082564207650555,0.0,0.0

teaching,edna-22,2018/04/12,"I feel like I’ve lost my way. Ever since I was 5 years old I’ve wanted to be a teacher. I can’t remember ever wanting something more. Whilst I was never an exceptionally intelligent student, I made good grades and finished high school with good exam results! My first year at college was daunting but I learned a lot about education and where I wanted to focus on in teaching for the future. I had chosen to follow in the footsteps of my grandmother and become an Additional support needs teacher. This lead to me taking a specialised course in my second year to focus on that. That second year was probably my favourite, I had exceptional grades for once, my placement was fantastic and my review even better. Then I transferred to a university degree that I was lead to believe would let me specialise in ASN teaching. I was beyond excited to continue with my teaching goals. Around Christmas into the course, I lost my motivation. I had never felt more anxious about assessments whilst not caring about them in the slightest. While my friends were striving for the perfect grades I felt like I was sinking. And I still do! I feel like I’ve totally left myself down this year and I don’t know what I can do to fix this. I still want to teach but I feel like I can’t continue on this course. 
Is there any advice that you can offer me from experienced teachers to a confused student?",4.496760710553815,6.6664555708812285,5.1770480668756536,79.07616771159877,71.83524904214559,7.3508185301288735,30.254440961337515,8.150884317080207,2.3612436781609194,1108,48,191,17,22,357,137,261,0.048,0.773,0.179,0.988,0,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,0,1,1,9,12,15,0,1,12,0,23,0,0,5,6,43,41,10,0,6,5,0,5,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,9,11,0,0,9,0,0,3,6,3,0,3,17,6,39,12,36,21,4,41,0,2,0,0,4,16,0,2,25,146,48,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1156018111786298,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08044834919227438,0.0,0.0,0.13364581318362065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10531246397550413,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13065353070088004,0.0,0.1332840738513066,0.0,0.10462711687955736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12061517284179885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07813631839193919,0.21401902378471524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17944875603248842,0.2535415527964605,0.2271739298453966,0.0,0.0,0.10062628544636963,0.0,0.0,0.09139861887206407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19844957615717135,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12499089959106545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0650148225834134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12853376349344192,0.12097020492122595,0.0,0.2311824583305537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2582777883079444,0.10057479524469913,0.0,0.11193872738663938,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08771826997219481,0.18248116943390344,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12413640116141643,0.1259860971945983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12754787236430778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1340113260621178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11972635106389265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09785933829772513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09107345076065997,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1889497526551979,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13424592620346926,0.0,0.0,0.08894720079782446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2791066350286777,0.0939013750162441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08403723136887806,0.0,0.0,0.38090799190270297
teaching,jerkychemist,2018/04/12,"How to cheer up wife about teaching position? So my wife just accepted her first teaching position to be a middle school earth science teacher for next year. 

She signed her papers and everything then they called her and told her she will actually be teaching remedial math for all 3 grades! 

Math is her worst subject and isn't even certified for that. She is really bummed and I was wondering if you all had any stories or advice that I could give her to Cheer her up?

teaching,mckphysics,2018/04/12,"Research re: IGCSE Sciences I teach at an international school and we use Cambridge's IGCSE for our early high school. From my experience, the science curriculum seems rather scattered and very broad/shallow. I'm not wanting to bad-mouth the curriculum, but I am struggling to understand the design philosophy (again, specifically for science).

I keep hearing that it is reputable, respected, and researched, but I can't seem to find anything in my internet searches. Does anyone know where I can find research or curriculum philosophy for the IGCSE science courses? It's less a matter of doubting it's efficacy and more a matter of wanting to understand WHY the course was designed the way it was/what makes it effective. Hopefully understanding these things will help me shape my instruction to be more useful to students.

teaching,StarkVR,2018/04/12,"Virtual Reality &amp; Education I would like to talk about virtual reality in education. Turns out virtual reality headsets are not only revolutionizing the way our children play video games, it's also changing the way they learn. In fact, many schools are now using VR headsets in the classroom. Many big companies such as Google and Discovery Channel are currently producing hundreds of educational videos and documentaries for virtual reality headsets. The experience is AMAZING! Kids learn in an interactive and immersive environment and they actually love it!

If you have kids and you don't have a VR headset at home, I strongly recommend you take a look at www.starkvrpro.com Stark VR headsets are very impressive. You can e-mail them and they will explain you how it works and how to get VR educational content. It's really simple!

I'd like to see your reasoning. :)",3.884566666666668,7.049253390000002,5.359999999999999,71.47666666666666,80.1,8.933333333333335,33.333333333333336,9.2995712137729,4.180833333333334,449,25,70,14,12,150,76,100,0.021,0.754,0.225,0.9678,1,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,0,2,0,3,2,6,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,2,0,18,14,6,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,2,5,5,12,11,2,10,0,0,2,0,3,5,0,1,5,42,8,9,0.0,0.0,0.38606277950457785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2690314928066789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1651608322265356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20758655653222816,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17310250033163854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.386986989281896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20669229903700967,0.0,0.0,0.3318227549505988,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0966386546458797,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1661083120965269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21023785434125208,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2103924110401023,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2033788481039551,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2001915469889391,0.15762680708460586,0.0,0.0,0.22346594423099006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11534302675565107,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16321173770940975,0.11667186994500965,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14400606952632164,0.0,0.0,0.140516629822161,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,adiostrasero,2018/04/13,"Hey coworker - if you don’t want kids to say you’re rude... ...stop being rude. 

Like seriously, this woman (who like me, doesn’t have her own classroom, so doesn’t have an in-depth relationship with these kids) takes her frustration with teachers out on the kids. She’s running a test, kids show up at the wrong time because their *teacher* sent them at the wrong time, and she’s like “you’re not supposed to be in here - bye.” She overheard one of them saying she was rude and she couldn’t believe it. Uh...

And yet she complains all the time about how her son’s teacher treats him with no sense of irony.

I asked the person with whom I've been communicating with whether this position was just for this school year, or if it was a hire for this year and next, and what he said was that it's officially just for this school year, and that at the end of the year, the school distributes offer letters and I am free to apply for any other position at the school.

I am worried that if I accept this job and I am not kept on for next year, I am really limiting my chances at finding another teaching position for 2018-19.

teaching,ErekKing,2018/04/14,"Considering pursuing teaching career Hi y'all

I would like to seek some advice. I am interested in switching careers, and am looking at the idea of becoming a history or social studies teacher in particular. 
My initial forays into researching the idea suggest New York (where I currently live) or Massachusetts would be good places based on pay, a vague sense of the job market being better due to being higher population states, and the fact that, since I already live in the northeast, it would be less disruptive to my living situation than moving to, say, California, if I pursue teaching certifications. I have a bachelor's in Arabic and because of the economy's poor state when I graduated college, I took work where it is an irrelevant skill because I needed the money, and my Arabic skills are rustier than I would like them to be. 

So my questions are:
1. does anyone have advice on what colleges in NY or Mass would be good to try and get into? I live between Buffalo and Syracuse, so obscure schools that are hidden gems are welcome suggestions, as well as ones in NYC, Hudson river valley, Boston area, etc.
2. How weird is my bachelor's background going to look in this context? I have a decent number of social studies relevant undergraduate coursework because of general education requirements plus some history and anthro-style courses which fit into my major. I am open to taking more if it helps me out here.
3. Broad level advice: I have heard about trying out substitute teaching and stuff like that, so what is your weirder advice for people looking to change careers as an adult, or what other career options would you suggest for someone who finds teaching history attractive?",9.32726821192053,9.246745129139072,9.39310430463576,61.33713990066225,59.62913907284768,11.523509933774836,40.72930463576159,10.9516,4.904509271523179,1367,66,197,30,16,451,182,302,0.036000000000000004,0.852,0.112,0.9719,3,0,0,0,0,0,35.0,0,3,1,5,10,11,0,0,13,0,26,0,0,1,1,40,35,23,0,9,6,0,0,3,0,6,0,2,0,1,14,15,0,1,4,0,3,3,0,1,1,1,2,5,25,10,39,21,6,33,0,0,3,0,17,24,0,11,7,146,39,19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3988451057814511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1126025135570358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07134800311503173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866059819892872,0.1126939983504898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0902451550584995,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1079436743030065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08929496870743173,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11380039684655265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09326174746201688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05331113744520398,0.0,0.05799108413298491,0.17117085231559714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06839455418199895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2303790981626561,0.0,0.0,0.10125790839608978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14955322354095854,0.0,0.36040903275019454,0.0,0.2570610447963471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10845125049351152,0.0,0.07566058504906334,0.0,0.09854984926761767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06914423016039924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07074095680692309,0.0,0.10660898001228164,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11430697150595087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08114546488872253,0.0,0.10326886029734827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08440767003803272,0.11469604984189237,0.0,0.2080317094416192,0.08645726726938423,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11681017982631747,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0767205880026264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11336902278778385,0.13855549176589366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09174526625776644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07428556749554265,0.0,0.0,0.4349132348338575,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,gpc0321,2018/04/14,"Tricky situation involving applying for a position at a new school...advice needed. I have been teaching at my current school for all 16 years of my teaching career. I am department chair, I'm on the School Improvement Team, I sponsor a club, and I'm a mentor teacher to ILTs. I have a close relationship with my administrators, and I respect them. 

But...I'm burnt out. Terribly so. I love teaching, but I feel like I do more disciplining, managing, and just trying to get through the day anymore. 

Anyway, there is an opening at our public charter Montessori school. I know this because a former colleague who left my school to work there is now coming back to fill an opening with us next year. 

I really want to apply for the position at the Montessori school, but doing so will, of course, require that I list my principal as a reference. I know he'll give a good reference, but if I *don't* get the job at the Montessori school, I want to stay where I am. 

I've never switched teaching positions, so I'm not sure how this works. If I apply and interview at Montessori, they'll surely call and check my references, yes? And then if I don't get offered the job, I'll have a really awkward situation on my hands with my current administration.

What do I do?

teaching,mvp01235,2018/04/15,"Timeline of Job Applications - HELP Hi all!

I am moving to Massachusetts next year and have started applying for jobs. Some background: I'm certified in NYS with an Early Childhood and Childhood initial license, in the process of getting my provisional license in MA with Early Childhood (took and passed my MTELs, sent in paperwork, paid - just waiting for it to be approved).

I applied for about 10 jobs in early April (April 4) via Schoolspring and my application has only been looked at by one district, according to the website. When is it appropriate to start calling to check that my materials were received? I know teachers are typically not hired until the summer, but I am itching to know if/where I will be teaching so I can find an apartment!

teaching,doombucket03,2018/04/15,"Reading burnout Hi teachers.

So I just noticed a post [(link here)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8cdtdq/anybody_here_read_voraciously_as_a_kid_fell_off/) in which so many people described being burned out of reading in school, even if they were big readers as kids.  I experienced the same thing; I was a voracious reader up until my junior/senior year of high school, and then I couldn't pick up a book for pleasure for the next 10 years.  Even books that I would have otherwise enjoyed had to be analyzed and torn apart to the point where there was no joy in reading whatsoever.  As a reading teacher, it's bumming me out that so many people experience reading burnout.


Is this a result of having so much required reading in school?  I definitely see it on the Elementary level with Accelerated Reader, in which students have to read a metric ton of books each year.  AR is a huge focus in my school, and lots of kids start the year off strong, but by spring it's hard to get even the good readers to pick up a book.  Truthfully, even I can't read as much as they do without tiring myself out.


I'm wondering if there's some kind of middle ground here; a way to get kids to practice reading, read for pleasure, and not get burned out like I and so many others did.

If you are a teacher that uses benchmark tests (any test that you give to every student multiple times a year) it would really help me if you would respond to this quick survey.

teaching,PPpwnz,2018/04/16,"How important is previous experience? Hi everyone,

I am currently in my third year at a middle school in Arizona.  I am originally from Chicago and my goal is to be a high school social studies teacher there, preferably after this upcoming school year.  I currently have a high school position offered to me for 2018-2019, but I plan on relocating back to Chicago after that year anyway.

My question is this: how important do you think one year of high school teaching experience will be to hiring high schools?  I have a pretty solid living situation right now, I feel established at my school, I have great relationships with my students and colleagues, and I'm not a huge fan of the idea of moving for a year or two, tops, before moving once again after that.

Thanks for your input, and good luck with the rest of the school year!  We're almost there!",8.7225,8.083531910828025,8.523622611464969,68.90670780254779,61.10191082802547,11.671656050955415,36.82245222929936,10.9516,4.069484713375797,678,27,116,15,8,219,94,157,0.029,0.7759999999999999,0.194,0.9829,2,0,0,0,0,0,19.0,0,2,0,3,8,4,0,0,9,0,12,0,0,3,0,19,16,8,0,1,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,6,0,0,5,0,0,2,1,0,0,3,0,1,15,4,22,13,1,30,0,0,0,0,7,13,0,4,15,81,19,12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08976952850903676,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06893378307087403,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07628385032685675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08566251163572934,0.0,0.17538590419275396,0.0,0.0,0.04532872551925952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07519249421890574,0.0,0.09883724324083336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3788721619631391,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10120168692513884,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07916083183819331,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19056328610740705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09547220073137956,0.060747809060628974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09120425127163824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10042628377283196,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09624840875121647,0.0,0.07655890740450218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7258285462372537,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10076811499152616,0.0,0.09138485260736584,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0825358394527268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05744282249866897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08757307562180076,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34638226032464897

teaching,Scratchy_The_Toon,2018/04/16,"If you get promoted to a principal, are you ever able to step back down to teaching? So I'm on the fence about teaching (I feel like I would enjoy it, but I would hate the starting salary, especially since I am planning on living in a large metropolitan area for like 5 years after college and want to be completely self supporting because theres a chance I won't find anybody, or like not until later in my life and I want to be ready for worst case scenario.) Anyways, I've been thinking about becoming a bio teacher, but at the same time, I want to make more than 50,000 eventually, so I am thinking about either eventually becoming the activities director of my school, or take a leadership position. But I would want to be in teaching to actually teach, so I'm thinking that I would take the leadership position or activities director position until I've like paid off debt and like most of my mortgage etc, and then go back to teaching. I know it would be difficult to become these things anyways, but like I have some experience already (I was my school's treasurer for 3 years, which probably wouldn't help much but I will probably be a business minor if I take this route, and I will get very involved in clubs and helping at events etc my first few years before applying for the higher position.)


This post is a mess but TL;DR, if I become a teacher and move up to a higher position, can I eventually move back down and teach again?

Also I would enjoy being an activities director, so if I were to get that at some point I may not shift back, but for management I believe I may want to switch back after 5 or 6 years.",9.966282862706912,7.00379410443038,10.058987341772156,66.23927458617334,60.48734177215189,13.773709834469328,41.71275559883155,12.09199376347754,4.901936027263877,1291,55,242,32,13,433,153,316,0.073,0.7759999999999999,0.151,0.9527,3,0,0,0,0,0,31.0,0,2,0,3,18,14,1,0,16,0,27,1,0,1,1,53,51,31,0,16,18,0,1,6,0,12,1,0,0,1,9,8,0,1,6,1,2,4,4,4,0,1,4,1,30,10,41,29,11,41,0,0,0,0,6,15,0,13,27,176,39,14,0.08779392535191782,0.0,0.08567420671748578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0968827797600932,0.0702087703848571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3375405470001345,0.0,0.05351836202077508,0.38784597173115615,0.07470616414633731,0.0989136896298184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09205026038215652,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19582686808694003,0.0,0.07941463177789307,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08587930532764934,0.0,0.0,0.044391246570230684,0.06271999781346584,0.0,0.0,0.08024205725059007,0.07467746805479375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13760610730721196,0.0,0.04989531098929858,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08667832525251268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11769283509373905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04824924536391202,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06201144585089071,0.25735006370690977,0.0,0.07752364454501899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0586031269034081,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1866220972225012,0.06453863683218057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08299363696205234,0.0,0.08408231200465424,0.0,0.18931340100035746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17770427910023642,0.0,0.0,0.09158821128570777,0.0,0.0,0.07262404228849803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06214099223694133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09962750608427093,0.0,0.0,0.19803031732746432,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058326382922583936,0.16876440720652747,0.0,0.0,0.051193343892748745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07243918293900295,0.2589156591736615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3741977138353633,0.0,0.0,0.2261456379589015
teaching,wolfer1991,2018/04/17,"Advice needed about virtual reality in classrooms! A couple weeks ago, I went to a trade show about the new technologies in education. There was a company pitching the advantages of virtual reality in education. They pretty much convinced me and since they were giving out discount codes to teachers I got myself a VR headset (by the way the link is www.starkvrpro.com and the 15% discount code is: teach15)


So I tried the VR headset with the Google Expedition app and it's amazing! I definitely want to use it for my unit plan about the solar system. So I was wondering if any of you guys have already tried virtual reality in your classrooms? 


If so, how was the experience? Which VR apps do you recommend? Are there any do's and don'ts?


Your help is very appreciated!",4.678615384615384,7.323150114285718,5.972857142857144,71.42137362637365,72.85714285714286,9.450549450549447,32.1978021978022,9.851270322608157,3.786972527472527,616,30,103,18,13,206,88,140,0.015,0.805,0.18,0.9728,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,0,4,2,2,9,3,0,0,13,0,12,0,0,2,0,14,19,10,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,6,0,0,2,1,3,1,1,0,0,0,6,0,14,3,16,13,1,11,0,0,0,0,9,5,0,3,3,71,17,3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21504700912532798,0.19507619333050025,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24284950131696864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2993063293123684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24350004451627225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2152678373175455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21110840127468955,0.0,0.0,0.17600775189607232,0.0,0.0,0.2179010136801552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.147506328688495,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16177462918779614,0.16317695554112294,0.0,0.21254216263459225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22388734163988427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1820417673507846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2988222111314688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19006730439682185,0.0,0.18157839294152608,0.12980126885124266,0.17467900930026276,0.17652454185732894,0.0,0.0,0.20400439314479052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23865336694171546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,takingtacet,2018/04/17,"Today in my internship was rough but one kid said something funny enough to carry me. We were struggling with every. Class. (Music p-5) Whether it was me or their actual teacher—who is an absolutely amazing educator—they were just all over the place, talking, fighting, picking up spiders and putting them in girls faces, getting nosebleed everywhere and refusing to go to the nurse, flipping the bird—all pretty uncommon to happen in one day at this school. It’s generally really good. 

The last class of the day, 3rd grade, was being insane. We had to put away instruments and then we couldn’t even sing because they couldn’t handle it. Teacher mentions something about how yes, some of them are good but not everyone etc.

Would really appreciate some advice on this thanks. ,3.3520000000000003,5.935842200000002,5.616666666666671,72.60500000000002,77.0,9.333333333333334,25.0,9.725611199111238,2.8155,252,9,46,8,6,88,47,60,0.055,0.703,0.242,0.9349,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,0,0,0,1,2,3,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,7,7,5,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,3,11,5,2,7,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,2,31,8,4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3497615905260679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3002117297656469,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4040554021063236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3789924366289875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22929685308066936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3295305919448116,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20870979498602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3976694626747544,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2542606850818921,0.0,0.0,0.230492902721248

teaching,Ddogwood,2018/04/18,"Any suggestions for studying The Arrival film? (high school) I'm planning a film study unit for my Grade 12 English class. I'm planning to use the film *The Arrival* as the main focus for study. I want to look at the film's nonlinear narrative structure, the director's use of visuals to enhance storytelling, and the connection between language and ideas/modes of thinking.

For classroom activities, I'll have the students complete a viewing worksheet to get them thinking about the concepts I want to work on. I was also thinking about having them do a project where they tell a story out of sequence, and watch a different ""alien encounter"" movie (E.T., Contact, Starman, etc.) and write a comparative review.

Does anyone have any other suggestions for good film study projects, or activities that can help with exploring the language-thinking connection more?",6.918220720720723,9.491147263513517,6.042972972972972,73.70450450450451,66.22972972972973,8.717117117117118,40.03603603603604,9.2995712137729,4.356930630630632,697,41,102,14,12,211,93,148,0.0,0.937,0.063,0.7622,1,0,0,0,0,0,28.0,0,0,3,3,4,1,0,0,16,0,6,0,0,2,0,16,17,7,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,4,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,7,1,21,16,3,6,0,0,3,0,9,5,0,1,0,62,9,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16430714399693264,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2794411472542545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14366315783182354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2154220235543144,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21466308870762746,0.0,0.0,0.17980036753545522,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2291434049966568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10734492934071756,0.0,0.0,0.17233099805734106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13771622474764975,0.21708090177581188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17253555268370013,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20793757257776455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17958203184324814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5266046317658842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3549047941498155,0.0,0.0,0.2423725256073313,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1495781064892944,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

teaching,deadlylilflower,2018/04/18,"Active Shooter Drills I teach at a public high school in Florida. I went to high school a block away from Pulse Night Club in Orlando. Today I had to watch a ""Run, Hide, Fight"" video as training for how to respond to an active shooter. We already have a school resource officer so we won't be getting another under the new mandates. There will be new regular active shooter drills but there won't be any other added security features to the school. The video suggested we throw books at the shooter. I am disgusted and outraged at this response.
When I became a teacher, I did so with the intention of shaping young minds, not with the fear that I might have to take a bullet to protect their young lives. I love teaching, but it gets harder every year. Not to mention that our county is claiming a budget crisis and isn't going to be giving out scheduled raises anytime soon. I'm wondering if I should consider a different career path. Or at least I'd like to hear how other teachers are dealing with these issues.

teaching,crpet,2018/04/19,Middle School Science Tests I was wondering if someone could help me out. I am a first year middle school Science teacher and I am tired of creating my own tests. As we get closer to the end of the year I simply don't have the drive to create another Google Doc and battle with the formatting. Does anyone know where I can find a site that will provide me with pre-made tests? We are using Glencoe Science 7 and 8 text books. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!,4.660599078341012,6.250290881720427,5.324761904761908,80.55000000000003,70.29032258064517,7.894930875576037,28.3394777265745,8.418075326091056,2.0507800307219664,384,14,71,6,7,124,70,93,0.058,0.7959999999999999,0.145,0.8,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.0,2,1,0,1,1,3,1,0,6,0,11,1,0,1,0,16,16,5,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,8,0,0,4,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,11,2,8,11,1,11,0,0,0,0,5,6,0,2,4,44,12,6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15557612141937152,0.2398925029054129,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15996611169076014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1826597205006484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20020418671908904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2026284084030374,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20909792088969284,0.19459749466292506,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1195264757889808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2522273144906699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15334431820997052,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1257297885394939,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4630688265758278,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1938419054306853,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21062701115275287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26294536561584664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1975897676111767,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2480987640840501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1625165294559945,0.0,0.0,0.2946496160224742
teaching,math_and_hockey,2018/04/19,"I'm tired and drained with one quarter left I'm so tired.  I love teaching, but I don't know how much longer I can do it.  I'm more than ten years in and, I hate to admit this, but I have ugly cried three of the last four days.  The stress got to me. It doesn't help that I'm sick. Again. This never ending winter isn't helping.

I messed up. A student turned in a project two weeks late and after the end of a quarter and I cursed.  I apologized immediately, but the damange was done and now I have a meeting with my adminstrator.  Totally my fault. It wasn't the student or even the late project, but the accumulation of what felt like half a dozen punches Monday morning before 7:30.  It doesn't change that it happened. 

Add in the same student spending ten minutes yesterday to complain to me about their grade while explaining to me about how disrespectful I am, how much my student are afraid of me, how much the all hate me, and so on and I'm pretty much done for the week.  I hate myself for that upsetting me. I gave up crying over students years ago, but being angry with myself for being upset is just making it worse. 

I just... I'm tired.  I'm a strict teacher and I know they don't all hate me, but some of them do (and that's okay). I coach, I've been a class sponsor, I chaperone field trips, I do other extra curriculars. I come in way too early and stay way too late to offer tutoring hours.  I try my best. Sometimes that isn't good enough. 

I keep asking why I do so much when the students don't care (so many, many of them don't care this year - it's a problem) and so many of my co-worker seem to come in, teach and leave.   

I've been doing this long enough to know that it will get better.  The end of the year will be here soon enough.  Frustrating, this is probably going to be a major issue in keeping me from getting the summer school position that I wanted.  I've definitely written more than enough to identify me if anyone I work with is here. If so, pretend you didn't see this. 

It will get better.  But right now I am so tired. Is this really worth it?",1.6918411764705894,3.647265075294122,3.157985294117648,91.34568382352941,79.4235294117647,5.9441176470588255,21.448529411764707,6.961326702584282,0.4318999999999997,1607,46,350,18,40,526,200,425,0.213,0.706,0.081,-0.9963,0,0,0,0,0,0,58.0,0,1,4,4,25,22,5,4,23,1,37,6,0,5,4,53,75,35,0,4,12,0,1,1,0,3,5,0,0,0,26,19,0,2,7,2,2,4,11,13,0,10,11,2,45,9,41,57,19,49,0,0,1,1,16,12,0,5,31,247,71,15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06779127422921959,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0534737299345136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07149464635656358,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06507536122775665,0.0,0.0802567426159807,0.13527344393132176,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15594456109752242,0.0,0.0809013656417523,0.1317544385849755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16801037809557787,0.04932063111365256,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1565228024521721,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.20320485395589336,0.3160802067715649,0.0,0.05051161305132488,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0734288604573113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.119866509577728,0.0,0.043463018390819785,0.06414435954589702,0.06116476629744415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0676273889677795,0.0,0.0,0.3020164877091092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10252037224988966,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07531336012589482,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0798209742710866,0.0,0.1359505939098845,0.0,0.0,0.1260874697651242,0.06233806851830955,0.2588044508729688,0.08097693963950899,0.08309129300211603,0.0,0.0,0.037362263540726436,0.0,0.0,0.06767876810949387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06902248879705937,0.0,0.05104825948291336,0.2326036885787736,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2810929427974828,0.0,0.05898293142865485,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05182205147586063,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07780348752164902,0.08245395876049283,0.07317711142701479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04899242210899191,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06531000379770209,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07739769727377267,0.06094139378242457,0.06962079038262865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0756366241216549,0.0,0.0,0.08151313777055785,0.0,0.0,0.08760288916259099,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3515912044084743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05192211851877437,0.08318382248347207,0.07470584541152844,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0451074693521788,0.12140602519857613,0.12268871378849608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0690076079125621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11135073725565367,0.0,0.07793547926440675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19699189817094245
teaching,chemousey,2018/04/19,"MUltiple choice test taking strategies/tips. Hi teachers of Reddit.  

I am a medical lab technologist and am currently also assisting in teaching a group of students that are going through a 1 year internship in an attempt to get a degree and license in order to join the profession.  The license exam is 100 multiple choice questions and is computer adapted to adjust difficulty based on the performance of the person taking it as they progress.

So, I’m giving them a 45 minute to 1 hour presentation on good multiple choice test taking strategies!  I’ve read a few articles published by multiple universities and I believe I have a decent framework but I’d love to get more advice from the professionals; if anyone has any Golden advice or good references/reads they can link to I’d appreciate it.  

My current outline is (approx) 5 minute intro, how these strategies might help as well as outlining their exam format to them in case they haven’t researched it.  10-15 minutes of going through tips and tricks / strategies.  10-15 minutes for them to engage in my mock test that will be questions that almost none would know the answer to, but given these strategies they should be able to deduce many of the answers.  Followed by a 5-10 minute Q&amp;A period which I would guess will go long with students inquiring about their license exam format. 

Currently the bulk of my research suggests...

1. Read and answer each question in your head before reading the options

2. Read all options before selecting a final answer

3. Take notes as you progress through the test, answers can be given away by other questions

4. Eliminate nonsense answers and things you know to be wrong

5. Eliminate answers if they appear as an option twice for one question (if “erythrocytes” is option B and “RBCs” are choice C then neither can be right, as they are the same thing.)

6. In the event you do not know the answer the longest answers are often the correct ones.

7.  In the event you do not know the answer answers with definitive qualifiers are often wrong (definitely, always, all the time...)

8. In the event you do not know the answer Answers with possible qualifiers are often the correct response (sometimes, often, usually...)

That’s the bulk of what I’ve gotten so far.  Appreciate anyone to have taken the time to look this over and anyone with info that might help me better prepare this group for success.

teaching,thedeadwillwalk,2018/04/19,"How to handle my unique situation when interviewing? I taught at a very good school for 4 years. Was an aide there for 5 years prior.  In the last year of my employment, I went through a divorce. (I’m a straight male, divorcing a woman.) A male coworker began sexually harassing me under the guise of being a “shoulder to cry on” during my tough time. It started mildly, but quickly ramped up to being extremely inappropriate and stressful. I have copies of texts and messages over the course of a year where I tell him I’m not gay or interested and to stop his behavior. I really tried not to let it affect me. Despite being just shy of tenure, this behavior of his became too much for me and I went to my union to file a claim. After reviewing it, the administration decided that no harm had occurred and it was not a threatening work environment because all of his messages occurred outside of work hours. I was livid and felt betrayed, and the other guy even got a promotion.  I quit because I couldn’t continue to be in that environment. 

Now I’m having trouble addressing why I chose to leave such a good school right before tenure when I interview for new jobs. What’s the best way to answer this question without sounding like I’m a magnet for drama or even lying?",5.3256222654351015,6.63632781404959,6.4427564414195455,74.22584589207584,68.3801652892562,9.495770539620807,31.590666018473506,9.773937934552695,3.176463490520176,1009,42,179,23,17,338,148,242,0.181,0.7440000000000001,0.076,-0.9797,2,0,0,0,1,0,23.0,0,0,0,5,12,10,1,1,19,0,12,2,1,2,1,24,23,13,0,1,8,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,4,10,7,0,1,4,1,0,2,6,5,0,0,10,2,22,5,33,7,3,31,0,0,0,1,16,10,0,3,19,125,32,11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1791223494309317,0.0,0.12501824732294914,0.0,0.15418365889023028,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16138491285559045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19407877924888567,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14106640768639994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24645934359134025,0.11750548496629318,0.0,0.0,0.1454740715184653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14468677707355446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14579560304297412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11975955139735513,0.0,0.1555672512039723,0.0,0.15023583257936762,0.0,0.0717777760392582,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10800323311429352,0.0,0.0,0.1418964200560296,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16458421970890455,0.15626769034951468,0.0,0.0,0.09412082589500546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12546902627044146,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2973821205888933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16514443185942276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1039908557097598,0.0,0.0,0.12283184453744757,0.16829656350585653,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1284147082875921,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08567033525554442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09974915439644014,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12122453069335692,0.0,0.116618395952122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2723929473957208,0.1325726055209052,0.0,0.0,0.14162580536570898,0.0,0.21391927370327612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3784471016604618

teaching,yamgirl,2018/04/19,"Seeking opinions on student mental health! Hello r/teaching! (Mods please delete if not allowed!) I am currently a student studying interaction design. For my current project, we are studying a system and trying to find some part in it where design could be used to fix or improve it. Currently, we're exploring **the area of students with mental health conditions in the U.S. educational system (K-12)**.

One of the biggest problem areas my project partner and I pulled out is **the lack of training provided to teachers so that they are equipped to detect and help students struggling with mental health conditions**, especially since they are the ones who interact with students on a day to day basis. We are more interested in learning about this area by hearing from teachers, so if anyone has some time to answer a few questions, it would be really helpful and appreciated! (Feel free to PM me if there is any sensitive information)


Questions:

- Have you been trained to detect and deal with mental health conditions for your students? If so...
    - What type/how long/how frequently?
    - How do you feel about your training? Are you satisfied?
    - Can you give us an example of when you applied your knowledge? What happened? Were they able to receive the help they needed?
- How do the students diagnosed with mental health conditions…
    - Interact with others?
    - Perform in class?
- If someone were being bullied for mental health condition, what would you suggest to prevent it in a foundational way?


These questions are just to have a place to start the conversation, and don't need to all be answered. If you have any other thoughts or ideas about this topic, I would love to hear about that as well.

Thank you very much in advance!",4.308466666666668,7.578439980000002,4.298000000000002,79.09066666666669,79.2,6.666666666666668,31.333333333333336,7.8897218956490685,2.8031333333333337,1374,69,212,25,36,423,166,300,0.037000000000000005,0.843,0.12,0.9763,4,0,0,0,0,0,61.0,3,11,4,2,14,7,0,1,15,0,28,8,0,4,1,56,41,21,0,14,10,0,2,0,1,3,7,2,0,1,15,15,0,1,14,0,1,4,2,2,1,2,4,4,24,6,43,29,8,31,0,0,0,1,39,15,0,14,9,160,39,11,0.08596421088577524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11691722248145167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06010817501879366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06863542742078843,0.0,0.0,0.11087960875919227,0.08862532674740116,0.0,0.08725186451663842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08693217591876126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07856973137660819,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0824647042254061,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07601786778512483,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5482556178231065,0.19377582671362606,0.0,0.17285999552681935,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0970431304903285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07607562149795287,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07758605659128699,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5197902334480742,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.063193586169921,0.12748274624648268,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11650314813493096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09309086323809793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08981430382602025,0.09436288898454412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08225614009741661,0.0,0.0,0.2888987700778583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05507087473285098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0711104835743573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07283719691910902,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06084591092031695,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08986845804905996,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07914429572764538,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06824598114776964,0.05012642267336704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05836405635243865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10340436120147316,0.07424547741996151,0.0,0.07092947688123473,0.0,0.06823438929647263,0.0,0.0,0.07729214947300768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18319952693865654,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,Zelphh,2018/04/19,"Should I tell someone about this? I work as an instructional assisstant at an elementary school in a less well off area. The only training I've had relevant to the job is how to have appropriate boundaries with students. Pretty basic stuff. 

Today I had a student tell me that sometimes she gets so hungry that she shakes. I asked if that happens a lot and she said that it does. I didn't ask her anything more about it.

Just to be clear, I didn't start asking her about her life at home. Another student was doing that thing where if you lift your heel up so your foot rests at a 45-ish degree angle it makes your leg shake a little and they asked why her leg was shaking. This is what lead the student telling me about her shaking from hunger.

This has me feeling a little concerned but I don't know if I'm overreacting. Should I let the principal know? Would telling him help at all? Is this something that can be expected for the area I'm in?

I'm sick of lecturing, notes, assignments, worksheets, tests, quizzes, grades, deadlines, etc. Deep down I know that these things are not engaging, fun, authentic, etc. So, With summer break on the horizon, I'm starting to think about how to be more innovative. What does innovative and authentic teaching and learning look like to you? What policies and practices will help me to break free from traditional teaching? How do I make learning more engaging, fun, authentic, etc.?

teaching,AutumnAnatomy,2018/04/20,"Had a great day today! I took on a role as a music teacher at a primary school (UK - considered middle school in the US - I think) and I was so unprepared and flustered when I started on Monday. 

Basically I’ve been working my way through the years, from 5 year olds to 11 year olds.

I was so scared of the older children but I’ve been working hard on my planning and building a rapport with the kids at this school during my lunch duty and break times.

So today, I was teaching a fairly difficult Beyoncé song and there were a lot of moving parts and their normal teacher had to keep coming in to keep order at certain times, but the majority of the class had the utmost respect for me and were enthusiastic participants!

I have to add that I’m an unqualified teacher and even though I studied music for 10 years and then got a degree in something completely unrelated, I still have a huge passion for it and today just opened my heart up so much.

I started my application for teacher training to obtain my QTS (Qualified Teacher Status), starting this September!

Sorry, I just had to get all of this out! I’m buzzing!",6.916007751937991,6.750920534883722,7.643081395348839,72.17702519379846,64.58139534883722,9.957364341085274,36.0562015503876,9.516144504307137,3.420294573643412,885,39,158,15,12,296,123,215,0.049,0.848,0.103,0.9378,0,0,1,0,0,0,21.0,1,0,1,4,11,6,0,1,17,0,13,3,1,0,2,27,25,20,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,5,15,1,3,1,1,0,3,0,2,0,0,13,2,20,4,29,12,5,40,0,0,0,1,5,14,0,1,20,112,25,9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11193755239468273,0.13624661414330114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08380485376760377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08582855186052737,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06789177321248759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10393022513185267,0.14326666556811532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1164066947449832,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15398743299494155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2310051470343604,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11047601431925297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13811274821671546,0.09552575639985113,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12732014910098624,0.0,0.0,0.27271434754369,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14071958348467808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1300992889022494,0.3945389113349543,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10003929737921832,0.0,0.1454646613636914,0.2759307716232036,0.0,0.1037755807961993,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08326458094498372,0.12767194629888134,0.0,0.1515458998834666,0.0,0.3695227547857343,0.0,0.14437553489345006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15630984752556715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10314562038781667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18920545098300234,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.33472558738301844

Can anyone provide me some insight in regards to the pros/cons of 8th grade students vs 6th grade students?",6.40870588235294,6.600744223529414,5.894117647058824,83.08352941176473,65.58823529411765,7.741176470588236,35.82352941176471,6.742157984588678,2.3250470588235297,349,16,66,2,5,107,53,85,0.037000000000000005,0.908,0.055,0.3736,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,8,0,0,2,0,10,11,7,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,3,1,10,9,2,1,0,0,1,0,3,1,0,2,0,38,6,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3782521690068111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5413136386304994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3250514927622222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3662664624210115,0.2583803217046064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2845498973896187,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26229686315176554,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3279734252420861,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,ahoradevoar,2018/04/20,"[UK] Another job interview with a teaching recruitment company. I'm skeptical. Should I go? I had an interview last month with a teaching recruitment company. It sounded awesome on the phone and then when I got there (after spending over 30 quid for a train ticket mind you) I spent 10 minutes filling out paperwork. Then they just shooed me out the door and never really asked about what I was looking for or experience. I never heard back from them and when I email them I get no reply. They said they'd email me if they needed any more paperwork from me.

I just got a call a minute ago from another teaching recruitment agency. They want me to interview with them on Wednesday. I am not sure if I should go. It will cost me well over 20 quid again and I don't have money to just splash at these dud interviews.

I want to be a teaching assistant full-time and all that, but these interviews are something else. Is this normal? Should I go?

teaching,Amandamc2315,2018/04/20,"Need Advice? I noticed a lot of people post here looking for advice. One great resource that I feel is often overlooked is listening to podcasts. I know the life of a teacher is very busy and it can be hard to find time to sit and read an article or attend PD. I enjoy listening to podcasts while I’m driving. My drive to school is about 10-15 minutes, depending on the traffic, and some podcasts last exactly that long! I have another teacher friend who enjoys listening to them while she is getting ready in the mornings. There are many great podcasts out there, but some of my personal favorites are Truth for Teachers by Angela Watson, Teach 4 the Heart by Linda Kardamis, and The Cult of Pedagogy by Jennifer Gonzales. I hope this helps some teachers who feel discouraged or who simply desire some fresh ideas!

teaching,notwutiwantd,2018/04/20,"Oh, you only want singles? OK! I posted this on r/maliciouscompliance, as well...

As part of an incentive/reward program I have, I give out toy money and the students can use it as a classroom currency (to buy toys, games, etc.). Part of the system I have, is that the students change small bills for larger denominations, this enables me to not have runaway inflation. There was a time that I did not do that, and I gave out five dollar bills until I corralled the singles. This tidbit is useful in understanding the students' thought process...

A few days ago, I realized I was running out of singles and, using superb observational skills, I noticed two students with a gigantic stack of singles. They knew the drill, and they were not following through with it. Fast forward to today, and I am critically low in singles. Another student jumps on the bandwagon - after me asking him for his singles for which I can give him larger bills, he answers, ""No, I only want singles."" I smiled and moved on.

Alas, I ran out of singles. However, their plan did not quite work...

I circulated among the class, handing out five dollar bills, as I had no more singles - and skipped over those three students. Not once, not twice, but FIVE times. Suffice it to say, they were not enthused. A common refrain was, ""Why can't we get fives?? We're doing our work!!"" I called for attention in the class and made an announcement, ""There are some students that are upset that they are not getting any money. I feel terrible, I don't have any more singles, and they ONLY WANT SINGLES!"" The class burst out laughing.

I had my singles back before the period was over.",4.526125827814568,6.612731519867553,5.062921854304637,80.27976026490069,71.5496688741722,7.348556291390729,30.62304635761589,8.109356740369918,2.3309349403973503,1277,56,225,19,25,408,161,302,0.053,0.88,0.067,0.4774,1,0,0,0,0,0,71.0,2,1,6,7,4,7,0,1,18,1,26,1,1,4,0,43,45,15,0,3,9,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,13,18,0,1,7,3,10,6,12,3,1,7,15,3,36,4,37,30,19,36,0,1,0,0,20,18,0,1,12,180,49,14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12496080273194098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1917279527300294,0.1478186306411239,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1317872912307887,0.0,0.0,0.10839671090143536,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11995451434642715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1439454441237905,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14912685603933098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0909135537763872,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15721806309943182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07127832735641255,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1473013100659756,0.2704612473347597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13338858564860562,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14982808510142462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16049451306230225,0.0,0.15012773245250444,0.0,0.3216405763825055,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3053120874359325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13500964768966206,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1499382314606561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11210446687905704,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1119138991656244,0.16440069637079294,0.0,0.1336224388306181,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13770654877835525,0.14675404089734514,0.0,0.3652567111090365,0.0,0.0,0.24944208425979805,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12674835465676712,0.0,0.12720289118932046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2052546979012599,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
teaching,sgjohns1987,2018/04/20,"Hilarious Copying Anyone have any stories of students copying other people's work that it is so ridiculous you have to laugh?

We just got done covering the Renaissance. One assignment has students experiment with mirror writing, same as what Da Vinci used.
